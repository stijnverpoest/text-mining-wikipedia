The requirement for dietary nutrient intake applies to [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], and [[protist]]s. Nutrients can be incorporated into cells for [[metabolism|metabolic purposes]] or [[excretion|excreted]] by cells to create non-cellular structures, such as [[hair]], [[scale (anatomy)|scales]], [[feather]]s, or [[exoskeleton]]s. Some nutrients can be metabolically converted to smaller molecules in the process of releasing energy, such as for [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[protein (nutrient)|protein]]s, and [[fermentation]] products ([[ethanol]] or [[vinegar]]), leading to end-products of water and [[carbon dioxide]]. All organisms require water. Essential nutrients for animals are the energy sources, some of the [[amino acid]]s that are combined to create [[protein]]s, a subset of [[fatty acid]]s, [[vitamin]]s and certain [[mineral (nutrient)|minerals]]. Plants require more diverse minerals absorbed through roots, plus carbon dioxide and oxygen absorbed through leaves. [[fungus|Fungi]] live on dead or living organic matter and meet nutrient needs from their host.\\n\\nDifferent types of organism have different essential nutrients. Ascorbic acid ([[vitamin C]]) is essential, meaning it must be consumed in sufficient amounts, to humans and some other animal species, but not to all animals and not to plants, which are able to synthesize it. Nutrients may be [[organic compound|organic]] or inorganic: organic compounds include most compounds containing carbon, while all other chemicals are inorganic. Inorganic nutrients include nutrients such as [[iron]], [[selenium]], and [[zinc]], while organic nutrients include, among many others, energy-providing compounds and vitamins.\\n\\nA classification used primarily to describe nutrient needs of animals divides nutrients into [[list of macronutrients|macronutrients]] and [[micronutrient]]s. Consumed in relatively large amounts ([[gram]]s or [[ounce]]s), macronutrients ([[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, proteins, water) are used primarily to generate energy or to incorporate into tissues for growth and repair. Micronutrients are needed in smaller amounts ([[milligram]]s or [[microgram]]s); they have subtle [[biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[physiology|physiological]] roles in cellular processes, like [[vascular smooth muscle|vascular functions]] or [[action potential|nerve conduction]]. Inadequate amounts of essential nutrients, or diseases that interfere with absorption, result in a deficiency state that compromises growth, survival and reproduction. Consumer advisories for dietary nutrient intakes, such as the United States [[Dietary Reference Intake]], are based on deficiency outcomes{{clarify|date=January 2018}} and provide macronutrient and micronutrient guides for both lower and [[Tolerable upper intake levels|upper limits]] of intake. In many countries, macronutrients and micronutrients in significant content{{clarify|date=January 2018}} are required by regulations to be displayed on food product labels. Nutrients in larger quantities than the body needs may have harmful effects.<ref name=\\\"Ensminger1994\\\">{{cite book|author=Audrey H.

Carbohydrates are classified according to their number of sugar units: [[monosaccharide]]s (such as [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]), [[disaccharide]]s (such as [[sucrose]] and [[lactose]]), [[oligosaccharide]]s, and [[polysaccharide]]s (such as [[starch]], [[glycogen]], and [[cellulose]]).\\n* [[Protein]]s are [[organic compound]]s that consist of [[amino acid]]s joined by [[peptide bond]]s. Since the body cannot manufacture some of the [[amino acid]]s (termed [[essential amino acid]]s), the diet must supply them. Through digestion, [[protein]]s are [[protein catabolism|broken down]] by [[protease]]s back into free amino acids.\\n* [[Fat]]s consist of a [[glycerin]] molecule with three [[fatty acid]]s attached. Fatty acid molecules contain a -COOH group attached to unbranched [[hydrocarbon]] chains connected by single bonds alone ([[Saturated fat|saturated fatty acids]]) or by both double and single bonds ([[Unsaturated fat|unsaturated fatty acids]]). Fats are needed for construction and maintenance of [[cell membrane]]s, to maintain a stable body temperature, and to sustain the health of skin and hair. Because the body does not manufacture certain fatty acids (termed [[essential fatty acid]]s), they must be obtained through one's diet.\\n\\nFat has an [[energy]] content of 9{{nbsp}}[[kcal]]/g (~37.7 kJ/g) and proteins and carbohydrates 4{{nbsp}}kcal/g (~16.7 kJ/g).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\\n\\n===Micronutrients===\\nMicronutrients support metabolism.\\n\\n* [[Dietary mineral]]s are generally trace elements, salts, or ions such as copper and iron.

Although the four elements: [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]], are essential for life, they are so plentiful in food and drink that these are not considered nutrients and there are no recommended intakes for these as minerals. The need for nitrogen is addressed by requirements set for protein, which is composed of nitrogen-containing amino acids. [[Sulfur]] is essential, but again does not have a recommended intake. Instead, recommended intakes are identified for the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine.\\n\\nThe essential nutrient elements for humans, listed in order of [[Reference Daily Intake|Recommended Dietary Allowance]] (expressed as a mass), are [[potassium]], [[chloride]], [[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], [[zinc]], [[manganese]], [[copper]], [[iodine]], [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[selenium]] and [[cobalt]] (the last as a component of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>).

The requirement for dietary nutrient intake applies to [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], and [[protist]]s. Nutrients can be incorporated into cells for [[metabolism|metabolic purposes]] or [[excretion|excreted]] by cells to create non-cellular structures, such as [[hair]], [[scale (anatomy)|scales]], [[feather]]s, or [[exoskeleton]]s. Some nutrients can be metabolically converted to smaller molecules in the process of releasing energy, such as for [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[protein (nutrient)|protein]]s, and [[fermentation]] products ([[ethanol]] or [[vinegar]]), leading to end-products of water and [[carbon dioxide]]. All organisms require water. Essential nutrients for animals are the energy sources, some of the [[amino acid]]s that are combined to create [[protein]]s, a subset of [[fatty acid]]s, [[vitamin]]s and certain [[mineral (nutrient)|minerals]]. Plants require more diverse minerals absorbed through roots, plus carbon dioxide and oxygen absorbed through leaves. [[fungus|Fungi]] live on dead or living organic matter and meet nutrient needs from their host.\\n\\nDifferent types of organism have different essential nutrients. Ascorbic acid ([[vitamin C]]) is essential, meaning it must be consumed in sufficient amounts, to humans and some other animal species, but not to all animals and not to plants, which are able to synthesize it. Nutrients may be [[organic compound|organic]] or inorganic: organic compounds include most compounds containing carbon, while all other chemicals are inorganic. Inorganic nutrients include nutrients such as [[iron]], [[selenium]], and [[zinc]], while organic nutrients include, among many others, energy-providing compounds and vitamins.\\n\\nA classification used primarily to describe nutrient needs of animals divides nutrients into [[list of macronutrients|macronutrients]] and [[micronutrient]]s. Consumed in relatively large amounts ([[gram]]s or [[ounce]]s), macronutrients ([[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, proteins, water) are used primarily to generate energy or to incorporate into tissues for growth and repair. Micronutrients are needed in smaller amounts ([[milligram]]s or [[microgram]]s); they have subtle [[biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[physiology|physiological]] roles in cellular processes, like [[vascular smooth muscle|vascular functions]] or [[action potential|nerve conduction]]. Inadequate amounts of essential nutrients, or diseases that interfere with absorption, result in a deficiency state that compromises growth, survival and reproduction. Consumer advisories for dietary nutrient intakes, such as the United States [[Dietary Reference Intake]], are based on deficiency outcomes{{clarify|date=January 2018}} and provide macronutrient and micronutrient guides for both lower and [[Tolerable upper intake levels|upper limits]] of intake. In many countries, macronutrients and micronutrients in significant content{{clarify|date=January 2018}} are required by regulations to be displayed on food product labels.

They commonly function as [[enzymatic cofactor]]s, metabolic regulators or [[antioxidant]]s. Humans require thirteen vitamins in their diet, most of which are actually groups of related molecules (e.g. [[vitamin E]] includes [[tocopherol]]s and [[tocotrienol]]s):<ref>{{cite journal | author = Brigelius-Floh\\u00e9 R, Traber MG | title = Vitamin E: function and metabolism | journal = FASEB J. | volume = 13 | issue = 10 | pages = 1145\\u20131155 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10385606 | last2 = Traber | doi=10.1096/fasebj.13.10.1145}}</ref> vitamins A, C, D, E, K, [[thiamine]] (B<sub>1</sub>), [[riboflavin]] (B<sub>2</sub>), [[niacin]] (B<sub>3</sub>), [[pantothenic acid]] (B<sub>5</sub>), [[Vitamin B6|vitamin B<sub>6</sub>]] (e.g., [[pyridoxine]]), [[biotin]] (B<sub>7</sub>), [[folate]] (B<sub>9</sub>), and [[cobalamin]] (B<sub>12</sub>). The requirement for vitamin D is conditional, as people who get sufficient exposure to ultraviolet light, either from the sun or an artificial source, synthesize vitamin D in the skin.\\n\\n====Minerals====\\n{{Main|Mineral (nutrient)}}\\nMinerals are the [[exogenous]] [[chemical element]]s indispensable for life. Although the four elements: [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]], are essential for life, they are so plentiful in food and drink that these are not considered nutrients and there are no recommended intakes for these as minerals. The need for nitrogen is addressed by requirements set for protein, which is composed of nitrogen-containing amino acids. [[Sulfur]] is essential, but again does not have a recommended intake. Instead, recommended intakes are identified for the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine.\\n\\nThe essential nutrient elements for humans, listed in order of [[Reference Daily Intake|Recommended Dietary Allowance]] (expressed as a mass), are [[potassium]], [[chloride]], [[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], [[zinc]], [[manganese]], [[copper]], [[iodine]], [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[selenium]] and [[cobalt]] (the last as a component of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>). There are other minerals which are essential for some plants and animals, but may or may not be essential for humans, such as [[boron]] and [[silicon]].\\n\\n===Conditionally essential nutrients===\\nConditionally essential nutrients are certain organic molecules that can normally be synthesized by an organism, but under certain conditions in insufficient quantities. In humans, such conditions include [[Preterm birth|premature birth]], limited nutrient intake, rapid growth, and certain disease states.<ref name=\\\"Carver\\\" /> [[Choline]], [[inositol]], [[taurine]], [[arginine]], [[glutamine]] and [[nucleotides]] are classified as conditionally essential and are particularly important in neonatal diet and metabolism.<ref name=\\\"Carver\\\" />\\n\\n=== Non-essential nutrients ===\\nNon-essential nutrients are substances within foods that can have a significant impact on health.

They are all [[wristwatch]]-styled devices developed by the [[Galvan]] inventor [[Azmuth]] that transforms the user into [[List of Ben 10 aliens|any one of many alien beings]] (originally 1,000,906, but the number has increased by 9 via scanning additional species not originally in the database). Despite many seeing the Omnitrix as a weapon, its true purpose was to allow the beings of the universe to understand each other and to resurrect intelligent species that may go extinct.\\n\\nThe Omnitrix appears in the first two incarnations of the franchise (''[[Ben 10 (2005 TV series)|Ben 10]]'' and ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force]]''), but Ben had to destroy it and use the Ultimatrix in the ''[[Ben 10: Ultimate Alien|Ultimate Alien]]'' series. The Ultimatrix had most of the same functionality as the Omnitrix, but would allow the user to transform the alien into its Ultimate Form(how the species and its DNA would evolve in a one-million-year simulation). In the final episode of Ultimate Alien, Azmuth takes the Ultimatrix from Ben and replaces it with the New Omnitrix{{spaced ndash}}the original version has been a prototype.\\n\\nIn ''[[Ben 10: Omniverse]]'', the [[Ben 10: Omniverse#The Nemetrix|Nemetrix]], a knock-off of the original Omnitrix, is introduced. Unlike the Omnitrix and its succeeding models, the Nemetrix uses the DNA of the natural predators of sentient alien races which have the sole purpose of hunting Ben. Thus, only an animal can use the Nemetrix, as users of higher intelligence are unable to use it without incurring mental damage. In ''Omniverse'', Albedo recreates the Ultimatrix by using a Polymorphic Crystal to stabilize his transformations, making it so that he can stay in any form as long as he wants. It also allows him to transform into the Ultimate Forms of his aliens without first turning into their normal forms.\\n\\nIn ''[[Ben 10 (2016 TV series)|the Reboot series]]'', Ben's Omnitrix can augment enhancements onto his aliens. In Season 2, his aliens can become \\\"Omni-Enhanced\\\" with rock-like constructs and energy. However, the enhancements seems to happen at random. This energy is later revealed to be coming from a new alien species in his Omnitrix, which eventually gets its own form, \\\"Shock Rock\\\". In Season 4, Ben unlocks the \\\"Omni-Kix\\\" feature, which allows him to add armor plating onto his aliens. \\nThe Reboot series also introduces the AntiTrix, which is wielded by Kevin Levin. The AntiTrix allows Kevin to transform into 11 aliens, most of which are ones that Ben has used before, but significantly altered from Ben's version.\\n\\n===Plumbers===\\nThe '''Plumbers''' is an organization composed of both human and alien members, each of whom possesses a special badge. All badges bear the intergalactic peace symbol, a green [[hourglass]] shape, which is on the faceplate of the Omnitrix. Later, in ''Omniverse'', the Plumbers' symbol becomes a red dot.\\n\\nIn the original series, the Earth's Plumbers were a secret government organization that protected the universe from any threat. Their main base is located inside [[Mount Rushmore]] (where the Null Void projector and Sub-Energy were stored), with additional bases located inside [[Fort Knox]], the [[Space Needle]], [[Devils Tower]], the [[Navajo National Monument|Navajo Monument]], the [[Great Dismal Swamp]], and major cities such as [[Roswell, New Mexico|Roswell]], [[New York City]], [[New Orleans]], [[Denver]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], [[Orlando]], and [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]]. Their main adversary was Vilgax. [[Max Tennyson]] was a Plumber in his youth. Most of the Plumbers on Earth have disbanded; however, a few members remain in a semi-active capacity.\\n\\n===Forever Knights===\\nThe '''Forever Knights''' are a secret British society first formed during the [[Middle Ages]] that are dedicated to collecting and studying alien technology, usually by illegal means. Any aliens they capture along the way are dissected and studied, and any humans caught with them are deemed worthless and disposed of. They also have a robotic dragon that protects one of their castles. It is revealed in ''Ultimate Alien'' that the reason for their actions is to combat Diagon, an entity from another dimension that nearly conquered the Earth in the Middle Ages were it not for the Forever Knights' immortal Founder George. When George left them, the Forever Knights began to splinter under various self-titled Forever Kings who transformed their knights' duty into a [[Speciesism#In the media|genocidal policy toward anything alien]].\\n\\n===Transports===\\nEach series has featured some kind of main transportation. The wheeled motor vehicles, appearing like normal cars, are equipped with several pieces of Plumber technology such as a turbo engine, laser guns, and [[autopilot]]. They are often destroyed during the series.\\n\\nThe '''Rustbucket''' and the '''Rustbucket II''', is an old [[recreational vehicle|RV]] resembling a 1973 [[GMC motorhome]] owned by Max Tennyson. Despite being old, and even having been destroyed a few times, Max has great affection for it.\\n\\nThe '''Resolute''' is Tetrax Shard's spaceship\\n\\nThe '''Chimearan Hammer''' is Vilgax's spaceship\\n\\n'''[[List of Ben 10 characters#Ship|Ship]]''' is a Galvanic Mechamorph (Upgrade's species) that can transform himself into fully operational technology he's once touched. He merged with the Forever Knights spaceship and became the space transportation for Ben's team during the third season of ''Alien Force''. \\n\\nThe '''Rustbucket III''', a Plumbers' [[jet aircraft|jet]] that Kevin has upgraded with alien tech, later replaced him.\\n\\n'''Kevin's car''' is a [[Muscle car]] resembling a [[Dodge Challenger]] armed with Plumber technology as well as other various alien techs, including guns and off-road capabilities. It is the team's main transport in ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force|Alien Force]]'' and ''[[Ben 10: Ultimate Alien|Ultimate Alien]]''. It is damaged or destroyed often, mainly during fights or chase scenes, and Kevin is constantly busy repairing it. In Omniverse, after Ben destroyed it while aiming at Upgrade, Kevin gave it a new look. He painted it blue and placed a white circle with the number 11 on it, with only one stripe.\\n\\nThe '''Proto-TRUK''' is Rook's spaceship and the team's main transport in ''[[Ben 10: Omniverse|Omniverse]]''. It can transform into a small truck to camouflage itself among Earth vehicles. It was later destroyed and its parts were used by Ben 10,000 to build the Time Cycles.\\n\\n==Accolades==\\n\\n===Original series===\\n{| class=\\\"wikitable\\\" style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\"\\n|-\\n!

They are all [[wristwatch]]-styled devices developed by the [[Galvan]] inventor [[Azmuth]] that transforms the user into [[List of Ben 10 aliens|any one of many alien beings]] (originally 1,000,906, but the number has increased by 9 via scanning additional species not originally in the database). Despite many seeing the Omnitrix as a weapon, its true purpose was to allow the beings of the universe to understand each other and to resurrect intelligent species that may go extinct.\\n\\nThe Omnitrix appears in the first two incarnations of the franchise (''[[Ben 10 (2005 TV series)|Ben 10]]'' and ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force]]''), but Ben had to destroy it and use the Ultimatrix in the ''[[Ben 10: Ultimate Alien|Ultimate Alien]]'' series. The Ultimatrix had most of the same functionality as the Omnitrix, but would allow the user to transform the alien into its Ultimate Form(how the species and its DNA would evolve in a one-million-year simulation). In the final episode of Ultimate Alien, Azmuth takes the Ultimatrix from Ben and replaces it with the New Omnitrix{{spaced ndash}}the original version has been a prototype.\\n\\nIn ''[[Ben 10: Omniverse]]'', the [[Ben 10: Omniverse#The Nemetrix|Nemetrix]], a knock-off of the original Omnitrix, is introduced. Unlike the Omnitrix and its succeeding models, the Nemetrix uses the DNA of the natural predators of sentient alien races which have the sole purpose of hunting Ben. Thus, only an animal can use the Nemetrix, as users of higher intelligence are unable to use it without incurring mental damage. In ''Omniverse'', Albedo recreates the Ultimatrix by using a Polymorphic Crystal to stabilize his transformations, making it so that he can stay in any form as long as he wants. It also allows him to transform into the Ultimate Forms of his aliens without first turning into their normal forms.\\n\\nIn ''[[Ben 10 (2016 TV series)|the Reboot series]]'', Ben's Omnitrix can augment enhancements onto his aliens. In Season 2, his aliens can become \\\"Omni-Enhanced\\\" with rock-like constructs and energy. However, the enhancements seems to happen at random. This energy is later revealed to be coming from a new alien species in his Omnitrix, which eventually gets its own form, \\\"Shock Rock\\\". In Season 4, Ben unlocks the \\\"Omni-Kix\\\" feature, which allows him to add armor plating onto his aliens. \\nThe Reboot series also introduces the AntiTrix, which is wielded by Kevin Levin. The AntiTrix allows Kevin to transform into 11 aliens, most of which are ones that Ben has used before, but significantly altered from Ben's version.\\n\\n===Plumbers===\\nThe '''Plumbers''' is an organization composed of both human and alien members, each of whom possesses a special badge. All badges bear the intergalactic peace symbol, a green [[hourglass]] shape, which is on the faceplate of the Omnitrix. Later, in ''Omniverse'', the Plumbers' symbol becomes a red dot.\\n\\nIn the original series, the Earth's Plumbers were a secret government organization that protected the universe from any threat. Their main base is located inside [[Mount Rushmore]] (where the Null Void projector and Sub-Energy were stored), with additional bases located inside [[Fort Knox]], the [[Space Needle]], [[Devils Tower]], the [[Navajo National Monument|Navajo Monument]], the [[Great Dismal Swamp]], and major cities such as [[Roswell, New Mexico|Roswell]], [[New York City]], [[New Orleans]], [[Denver]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], [[Orlando]], and [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]]. Their main adversary was Vilgax. [[Max Tennyson]] was a Plumber in his youth. Most of the Plumbers on Earth have disbanded; however, a few members remain in a semi-active capacity.\\n\\n===Forever Knights===\\nThe '''Forever Knights''' are a secret British society first formed during the [[Middle Ages]] that are dedicated to collecting and studying alien technology, usually by illegal means. Any aliens they capture along the way are dissected and studied, and any humans caught with them are deemed worthless and disposed of. They also have a robotic dragon that protects one of their castles. It is revealed in ''Ultimate Alien'' that the reason for their actions is to combat Diagon, an entity from another dimension that nearly conquered the Earth in the Middle Ages were it not for the Forever Knights' immortal Founder George. When George left them, the Forever Knights began to splinter under various self-titled Forever Kings who transformed their knights' duty into a [[Speciesism#In the media|genocidal policy toward anything alien]].\\n\\n===Transports===\\nEach series has featured some kind of main transportation. The wheeled motor vehicles, appearing like normal cars, are equipped with several pieces of Plumber technology such as a turbo engine, laser guns, and [[autopilot]]. They are often destroyed during the series.\\n\\nThe '''Rustbucket''' and the '''Rustbucket II''', is an old [[recreational vehicle|RV]] resembling a 1973 [[GMC motorhome]] owned by Max Tennyson. Despite being old, and even having been destroyed a few times, Max has great affection for it.\\n\\nThe '''Resolute''' is Tetrax Shard's spaceship\\n\\nThe '''Chimearan Hammer''' is Vilgax's spaceship\\n\\n'''[[List of Ben 10 characters#Ship|Ship]]''' is a Galvanic Mechamorph (Upgrade's species) that can transform himself into fully operational technology he's once touched. He merged with the Forever Knights spaceship and became the space transportation for Ben's team during the third season of ''Alien Force''. \\n\\nThe '''Rustbucket III''', a Plumbers' [[jet aircraft|jet]] that Kevin has upgraded with alien tech, later replaced him.\\n\\n'''Kevin's car''' is a [[Muscle car]] resembling a [[Dodge Challenger]] armed with Plumber technology as well as other various alien techs, including guns and off-road capabilities. It is the team's main transport in ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force|Alien Force]]'' and ''[[Ben 10: Ultimate Alien|Ultimate Alien]]''. It is damaged or destroyed often, mainly during fights or chase scenes, and Kevin is constantly busy repairing it. In Omniverse, after Ben destroyed it while aiming at Upgrade, Kevin gave it a new look. He painted it blue and placed a white circle with the number 11 on it, with only one stripe.\\n\\nThe '''Proto-TRUK''' is Rook's spaceship and the team's main transport in ''[[Ben 10: Omniverse|Omniverse]]''. It can transform into a small truck to camouflage itself among Earth vehicles. It was later destroyed and its parts were used by Ben 10,000 to build the Time Cycles.\\n\\n==Accolades==\\n\\n===Original series===\\n{| class=\\\"wikitable\\\" style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\"\\n|-\\n!

Throughout his club career, he played for [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], [[Sydney FC|Sydney]] and [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], mainly as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]], between 1988 and 2009. He was the assistant manager of the [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago national team]] until the completion of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification \\u2013 CONCACAF Fourth Round|qualifying matches for the 2010 FIFA World Cup]]. Yorke scored 123 goals in the [[Premier League]], a record for a non-European which was not broken until [[Sergio Ag\\u00fcero]] in 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41133350|title=Manchester City 5-0 Liverpool|publisher=BBC Sport|date=9 September 2017}}</ref>\\n\\nAt international level, Yorke represented Trinidad and Tobago on 74 occasions between 1989 and 2009, scoring 19 goals. He helped his nation reach the semi-finals of the [[2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], and also helped Trinidad and Tobago to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup]] for the first time in its history, later representing his national side in the final tournament in 2006.\\n\\n==Club career==\\n===Aston Villa===\\nYorke was first discovered by [[Graham Taylor]], at the time the [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] manager, on a tour of the West Indies in 1989. Yorke appeared in a team that played a friendly match against Aston Villa, Taylor was impressed and offered Yorke a trial at Villa. Yorke was subsequently given a permanent contract and he made his [[Football League First Division|First Division]] debut for Aston Villa against Crystal Palace on 24 March 1990: Crystal Palace won the game 1\\u20130. During his time with Aston Villa, from 1989 to 1998, Yorke played initially as a right winger until the [[1995\\u201396 FA Premier League|1995\\u201396 season]], he then switched to [[Forward (association football)|centre forward]] and quickly established himself as one of the [[Premier League]]'s top strikers.\\n\\nYorke was an integral member of the Villa team that reached the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] Final in 1996. Villa won 3\\u20130 against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] with Yorke getting on the scoresheet. On 30 September 1996 he scored a hat-trick against Newcastle United in a 4\\u20133 defeat. Newcastle were leading 3\\u20131 at half-time and Aston Villa were down to ten men, with [[Mark Draper]] being [[Ejection (sports)|sent off]] late in the first half. Yorke showed great character in leading his team in a brave fight back by scoring two more goals in the second half to complete his hat-trick, although it was to no avail as Aston Villa still lost the game. Yorke thought he had scored a fourth goal to equalise the game at 4\\u20134, only for it to be ruled offside. It was performances like this that led to interest from Manchester United in August 1998. Yorke appeared for Aston Villa on 284 occasions, scoring 97 times. He also has the distinct honour of being the last ever Villa player to score in front of the old Holte End standing terrace, notching both goals in a 2\\u20131 victory on the final day of the 1993\\u201394 season, 7 May 1994.\\n\\nThe circumstances of his departure from Aston Villa were controversial. John Gregory, Aston Villa manager at that time, made it known that the club did not want to sell Yorke to Manchester United unless they were prepared to exchange striker [[Andy Cole]]. Yorke then approached Gregory to state that he wanted to leave the club, to which Gregory was later attributed as saying that he would have shot Yorke if he had had a gun in his office. Yorke played for Villa on the opening day of the season at Everton on 15 August 1998, however it appeared he made no effort during the match as he was unhappy at not being allowed to leave the club. Villa were left with no option but to sell the player and he was transferred to Manchester United for \\u00a312.6&nbsp;million on 20 August 1998.<ref>http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/features/on-this-day-20-aug-1998-dwight-yorke-joins-manchester-united-from-aston-villa.html</ref> \\n\\n===Manchester United===\\nIn his first season Yorke was a key player in guiding his club to a unique treble of the Premier League title, [[FA Cup]] and [[UEFA Champions League]], and forming a legendary partnership with [[Andrew Cole|Andy Cole]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/apr/24/joy-of-six-strike-partnerships |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=The Joy of Six: great strike partnerships |first=Scott |last=Murray |date=24 April 2009 |accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref> Yorke finished the season as the top league goalscorer with 18 goals and contributed goals against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]],<ref>{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Thorpe |title=Inter are Yorked by United |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/mar/03/newsstory.sport19 |publisher=The Guardian |date=3 March 1999 |accessdate=10 August 2014 }}</ref> and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in the Champions League, and he won the [[Premier League Player of the Season]].

Throughout his club career, he played for [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], [[Sydney FC|Sydney]] and [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], mainly as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]], between 1988 and 2009. He was the assistant manager of the [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago national team]] until the completion of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification \\u2013 CONCACAF Fourth Round|qualifying matches for the 2010 FIFA World Cup]]. Yorke scored 123 goals in the [[Premier League]], a record for a non-European which was not broken until [[Sergio Ag\\u00fcero]] in 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41133350|title=Manchester City 5-0 Liverpool|publisher=BBC Sport|date=9 September 2017}}</ref>\\n\\nAt international level, Yorke represented Trinidad and Tobago on 74 occasions between 1989 and 2009, scoring 19 goals. He helped his nation reach the semi-finals of the [[2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], and also helped Trinidad and Tobago to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup]] for the first time in its history, later representing his national side in the final tournament in 2006.\\n\\n==Club career==\\n===Aston Villa===\\nYorke was first discovered by [[Graham Taylor]], at the time the [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] manager, on a tour of the West Indies in 1989. Yorke appeared in a team that played a friendly match against Aston Villa, Taylor was impressed and offered Yorke a trial at Villa. Yorke was subsequently given a permanent contract and he made his [[Football League First Division|First Division]] debut for Aston Villa against Crystal Palace on 24 March 1990: Crystal Palace won the game 1\\u20130. During his time with Aston Villa, from 1989 to 1998, Yorke played initially as a right winger until the [[1995\\u201396 FA Premier League|1995\\u201396 season]], he then switched to [[Forward (association football)|centre forward]] and quickly established himself as one of the [[Premier League]]'s top strikers.\\n\\nYorke was an integral member of the Villa team that reached the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] Final in 1996. Villa won 3\\u20130 against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] with Yorke getting on the scoresheet. On 30 September 1996 he scored a hat-trick against Newcastle United in a 4\\u20133 defeat. Newcastle were leading 3\\u20131 at half-time and Aston Villa were down to ten men, with [[Mark Draper]] being [[Ejection (sports)|sent off]] late in the first half. Yorke showed great character in leading his team in a brave fight back by scoring two more goals in the second half to complete his hat-trick, although it was to no avail as Aston Villa still lost the game. Yorke thought he had scored a fourth goal to equalise the game at 4\\u20134, only for it to be ruled offside. It was performances like this that led to interest from Manchester United in August 1998. Yorke appeared for Aston Villa on 284 occasions, scoring 97 times. He also has the distinct honour of being the last ever Villa player to score in front of the old Holte End standing terrace, notching both goals in a 2\\u20131 victory on the final day of the 1993\\u201394 season, 7 May 1994.\\n\\nThe circumstances of his departure from Aston Villa were controversial. John Gregory, Aston Villa manager at that time, made it known that the club did not want to sell Yorke to Manchester United unless they were prepared to exchange striker [[Andy Cole]]. Yorke then approached Gregory to state that he wanted to leave the club, to which Gregory was later attributed as saying that he would have shot Yorke if he had had a gun in his office. Yorke played for Villa on the opening day of the season at Everton on 15 August 1998, however it appeared he made no effort during the match as he was unhappy at not being allowed to leave the club. Villa were left with no option but to sell the player and he was transferred to Manchester United for \\u00a312.6&nbsp;million on 20 August 1998.<ref>http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/features/on-this-day-20-aug-1998-dwight-yorke-joins-manchester-united-from-aston-villa.html</ref> \\n\\n===Manchester United===\\nIn his first season Yorke was a key player in guiding his club to a unique treble of the Premier League title, [[FA Cup]] and [[UEFA Champions League]], and forming a legendary partnership with [[Andrew Cole|Andy Cole]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/apr/24/joy-of-six-strike-partnerships |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=The Joy of Six: great strike partnerships |first=Scott |last=Murray |date=24 April 2009 |accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref> Yorke finished the season as the top league goalscorer with 18 goals and contributed goals against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]],<ref>{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Thorpe |title=Inter are Yorked by United |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/mar/03/newsstory.sport19 |publisher=The Guardian |date=3 March 1999 |accessdate=10 August 2014 }}</ref> and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in the Champions League, and he won the [[Premier League Player of the Season]].

He scored the first goal for Sydney FC in its first A-League regular season match, a diving header against the [[Melbourne Victory]]. Yorke came to Sydney FC with the biggest pedigree of all players in the A-League, having won the [[Treble (association football)|treble]] with Manchester United. Yorke scored 7 goals in the A-League, with three of them being from [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kicks]]. Sydney FC coach [[Pierre Littbarski]] moved Yorke into a midfield role and gave him the team captaincy.\\n\\nHe played a major role in leading Sydney FC to victory in the inaugural A-League Grand Final on 5 March against regional rivals [[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]]. He set up the only goal, scored by [[Steve Corica]], in front of a sell out crowd of over 41,000 at [[Aussie Stadium]], and was awarded the [[Joe Marston Medal]] as best player in the grand final. Yorke was the [[A-League#Marquee player|marquee player]] for Sydney FC \\u2013 meaning that his salary fell outside the salary cap. He was also a star name for the A-League as a whole. Aside from his footballing talents, the drawing power and credibility he brought both locally and internationally proved to be beneficial for the competition in its inaugural season, leading the [[Football Federation Australia|FFA]] to use his image and name for the promotion of the A-League's second season.\\n\\nDue to the schedule of football in Australia, Yorke returned to Manchester United for training from March to June 2006, to retain fitness for the World Cup.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Anstead |first1=Mike |title=Ferguson lends Yorke a hand to arm the Warriors |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/feb/28/newsstory.sport3 |accessdate=22 April 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=28 February 2006}}</ref>\\n\\nYorke returned to Sydney FC to take part in a friendly against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 2010.

This is typically reached through offer and an acceptance which does not vary the offer's terms, which is known as the \\\"[[mirror image rule]]\\\". An offer is a definite statement of the offeror's willingness to be bound should certain conditions be met.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of Irish Contract Law|last=Enright|first=M\\u00e1ir\\u00e9ad|publisher=Clarus Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> If a purported acceptance does vary the terms of an offer, it is not an acceptance but a counteroffer and, therefore, simultaneously a rejection of the original offer. The [[Uniform Commercial Code]] disposes of the mirror image rule in \\u00a72-207, although the UCC only governs transactions in goods in the USA. As a court cannot read minds, the intent of the parties is interpreted [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectively]] from the perspective of a [[reasonable person]],<ref>DiMatteo L. (1997). [http://www.cisg.law.pace.edu/cisg/biblio/dimatteo5.html The Counterpoise of Contracts: The Reasonable Person Standard and the Subjectivity of Judgment]. ''South Carolina Law Review''.</ref> as determined in the early English case of ''[[Smith v Hughes]]'' [1871]. It is important to note that where an offer specifies a particular mode of acceptance, only an acceptance communicated via that method will be valid.<ref>{{cite AustLII|HCA|10|1973|litigants=George Hudson Holdings Ltd v Rudder (1973) 128 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 387 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\\n\\n<!--  Commented out: [[File:Parkingticketcontract.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Unilateral contract of adhesion on timekeeping ticket dispensed by vending machine at parking lot entrance {{pufc|Parkingticketcontract.jpg}}]] -->\\nContracts may be [[wikt:Bilateral|bilateral]] or [[unilateral]]. A bilateral contract is an agreement in which each of the parties to the contract makes a [[promise]]<ref>[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/promise promise legal definition of promise. promise synonyms by the Free Online Law Dictionary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  or set of promises to each other. For example, in a contract for the sale of a home, the buyer promises to pay the seller $200,000 in exchange for the seller's promise to deliver title to the property. These common contracts take place in the daily flow of [[commerce]] transactions, and in cases with sophisticated or expensive [[condition precedent|precedent]] requirements, which are requirements that must be met for the contract to be fulfilled.\\n\\nLess common are unilateral contracts in which one party makes a promise, but the other side does not promise anything. In these cases, those accepting the offer are not required to communicate their acceptance to the offeror. In a reward contract, for example, a person who has lost a dog could promise a reward if the dog is found, through publication or orally. The payment could be additionally conditioned on the dog being returned alive. Those who learn of the reward are not required to search for the dog, but if someone finds the dog and delivers it, the promisor is required to pay. In the similar case of advertisements of deals or bargains, a general rule is that these are not contractual offers but merely an \\\"invitation to treat\\\" (or bargain), but the applicability of this rule is disputed and contains various exceptions.<ref>Feinman JM, Brill SR. (2006). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=943315&download=yes Is an Advertisement an Offer? Why it is, and Why it Matters]. ''Hastings Law Journal''.</ref> The High Court of Australia stated that the term unilateral contract is \\\"unscientific and misleading\\\".<ref>Wilmot et al, 2009, ''Contract Law'', Third Edition, Oxford University Press, page 34</ref>\\n\\nIn certain circumstances, an [[implied contract]] may be created. A contract is [[implied in fact contract|implied in fact]] if the circumstances imply that parties have reached an agreement even though they have not done so expressly. For example, John Smith, a former lawyer may implicitly enter a contract by visiting a doctor and being examined; if the patient refuses to pay after being examined, the patient has [[Breach of contract|breached a contract]] implied in fact. A contract which is [[implied in law contract|implied in law]] is also called a [[quasi-contract]], because it is not in fact a contract; rather, it is a means for the [[court]]s to remedy situations in which one party would be [[Unjust enrichment|unjustly enriched]] were he or she not required to compensate the other. [[Quantum meruit]] claims are an example.\\n\\n===Invitation to treat===\\n{{Main|Invitation to treat}}\\nWhere something is advertised in a newspaper or on a poster, the advertisement will not normally constitute an offer but will instead be an [[invitation to treat]], an indication that one or both parties are prepared to negotiate a deal.<ref>''[[Partridge v Crittenden]]'' [1968] 1 WLR 1204</ref><ref>[http://www.lexisnexis.com.wwwproxy0.library.unsw.edu.au/au/legal/search/casessubmitForm.do ''Harris v Nickerson'' (1873) LR8QB 286]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>''Household Fire Insurance v Grant'' 1879</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Carbolic smoke ball co.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|The Carbolic Smoke Ball offer]]\\nAn exception arises if the advertisement makes a unilateral promise, such as the offer of a reward, as in the famous case of ''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co]]'',<ref>{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co]] |parallelcite=[1893] 2 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 256 |year=1892 |court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=1 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> decided in [[Victorian era|nineteenth-century England]]. The company, a pharmaceutical manufacturer, advertised a smoke ball that would, if sniffed \\\"three times daily for two weeks\\\", prevent users from catching the [[Influenza|'flu]]. If the [[Panacea (medicine)|smoke ball]] failed to prevent 'flu, the company promised that they would pay the user [[pound sterling|\\u00a3]]100, adding that they had \\\"deposited \\u00a31,000 in the Alliance Bank to show our sincerity in the matter\\\". When Mrs Carlill sued for the money, the company argued the advert should not be taken as a serious, [[legally binding]] [[Offer and Acceptance|offer]]; instead it was a [[gimmick|\\\"mere puff\\\"]]; but the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] held that it would appear to a [[reasonable man]] that Carbolic had made a serious offer, and determined that the reward was a contractual promise.\\n\\nAlthough an invitation to treat cannot be accepted, it should not be ignored, for it may nevertheless affect the offer.  For instance, where an offer is made in response to an invitation to <span lang=\\\"simple\\\">treat</span>, the offer may incorporate the terms of the invitation to treat (unless the offer expressly incorporates different terms).  If, as in the ''Boots case'',<ref>[http://legal.thomsonreuters.com.au/product/AU/files/720502512/pharmaceutical_society_of_great_britian_v_boots_cash_chemists.pdf ''Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v.

Until the announcement is made any bidder may retract his bid.\\\"\\n\\n====Electronic contracts====\\nEntry into contracts online has become common. Many jurisdictions have passed e-signature laws that have made the electronic contract and signature as legally valid as a paper contract.\\n\\nIn India, E-contracts are governed by the Indian Contract Act (1872), according to which certain conditions need to be fulfilled while formulating a valid contact. Certain sections in information Technology Act (2000) also provide for validity of online contract.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Linstone|first1=Harold A.|title=Understanding Electronic Contracts - The Indian Law of Contract|url=http://www.nalsarpro.org/CL/Modules/Module%201/Chapter3.pdf|website=Nalsar Pro|accessdate=3 April 2018|date=9 April 2013}}</ref>\\n\\nIn some U.S. states, email exchanges have become binding contracts. New York courts in 2016 held that the principles of real estate contracts to apply equally to electronic communications and electronic signatures, so long as \\u201cits contents and subscription meet all requirements of the governing statute\\u201d and pursuant to the Electronic Signatures and Records Act (ESRA).<ref>{{cite web|title=''Stonehill Capital Management LLC v.

For example, in ''[[Rose & Frank Co v JR Crompton & Bros Ltd]]'', an agreement between two business parties was not enforced because an \\\"honour clause\\\" in the document stated \\\"this is not a commercial or legal agreement, but is only a statement of the intention of the parties\\\".\\n\\nIn contrast, domestic and social agreements such as those between children and parents are typically unenforceable on the basis of [[public policy]]. For example, in the English case ''[[Balfour v. Balfour]]'' a husband agreed to give his wife \\u00a330 a month while he was away from home, but the court refused to enforce the agreement when the husband stopped paying. In contrast, in ''[[Merritt v Merritt]]'' the court enforced an agreement between an estranged couple because the circumstances suggested their agreement was intended to have legal consequences.\\n\\n===Consideration===\\n{{Main|Consideration}}\\nA concept of English common law, [[consideration]]  is required for simple contracts but not for special contracts (contracts by [[deed]]).  The court in ''Currie v Misa'' <ref>''Currie v Misa''  (1875)  LR 10 Ex 893</ref> declared consideration to be a \\u201cRight,  Interest,  Profit,  Benefit, or Forbearance,  Detriment,  Loss,  Responsibility\\u201d. Thus, consideration is a promise of something of value given by a promissor in exchange for something of value given by a promisee; and typically the thing of value is goods, money, or an act. Forbearance to act, such as an adult promising to refrain from smoking, is enforceable '''only''' if one is thereby surrendering a legal right.<ref>''Wade v Simeon'' (1846)  2 CB 548</ref><ref>''White v Bluett''  (1853)  2 WR 75</ref><ref>Bronaugh R.

''William & Mary Law Review''.</ref>\\n\\nIn ''Dunlop v. Selfridge'' Lord Dunedin adopted Pollack's metaphor of purchase and sale{{clarify|date=April 2018}} to explain consideration.

Atiyah, 'Consideration: A Restatement' in ''Essays on Contract'' (1986) p.195, Oxford University Press</ref> However, [[legislation]], rather than judicial development, has been touted as the only way to remove this entrenched common law doctrine. [[Lord Denning|Lord Justice Denning]] famously stated that \\\"The doctrine of consideration is too firmly fixed to be overthrown by a side-wind.\\\"<ref name=\\\"High Trees\\\">{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd]] |year=2007 |court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=1329 |parallelcite=[1947] [[Kings Bench|KB]] 130 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> In the United States, the emphasis has shifted to the process of bargaining as exemplified by ''[[Hamer v. Sidway]]'' (1891).\\n\\nCourts will typically not weigh the \\\"adequacy\\\" of consideration provided the consideration is determined to be \\\"sufficient\\\", with sufficiency defined as meeting the test of law, whereas \\\"adequacy\\\" is the subjective fairness or equivalence. For instance, agreeing to sell a car for a penny may constitute a binding contract<ref>''[[Chappell & Co Ltd v. Nestle Co Ltd]]'' [1959] 2 All ER 701 in which the wrappers from three chocolate bars was held to be part of the consideration for the sale and purchase of a musical recording.</ref> (although if the transaction is an attempt to avoid tax, it will be treated by the tax authority as though a market price had been paid).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/frequently-asked-questions-on-gift-taxes#2|title=Frequently Asked Questions on Gift Taxes|website=www.irs.gov|access-date=2016-05-26}}</ref> Parties may do this for tax purposes, attempting to disguise gift transactions as contracts. This is known as the ''peppercorn rule'', but in some jurisdictions, the penny may constitute legally insufficient ''nominal consideration''.

For example, in the early English case of ''Eastwood v. Kenyon'' [1840], the guardian  of a young girl took out a loan to educate her. After she was married, her husband promised to pay the debt but the loan was determined to be past consideration. The insufficiency of past consideration is related to the ''[[pre-existing duty rule]]''. In the early English case of ''[[Stilk v. Myrick]]'' [1809], a captain promised to divide the wages of two deserters among the remaining crew if they agreed to sail home short-handed; however, this promise was found unenforceable as the crew were already contracted to sail the ship. The pre-existing duty rule also extends to general legal duties; for example, a promise to refrain from committing a tort or crime is not sufficient.<ref>''Collins v. Godefroy'' (1831) 1 B. & Ad. 950.</ref>\\n\\n==Capacity==\\n{{Main|Capacity (law)}}\\nSometimes the capacity of either [[natural person|natural]] or [[Legal person|artificial]] persons to either enforce contracts, or have contracts enforced against them is restricted. For instance, very small children may not be held to bargains they have made, on the assumption that they lack the maturity to understand what they are doing; errant employees or directors may be prevented from contracting for their company, because they have acted ''[[ultra vires]]'' (beyond their power). Another example might be people who are mentally incapacitated, either by disability or drunkenness.<ref>see for a discussion of the position in English law, the [[Capacity in English law#lackofcapacity intoxication2016-07-24|article on Capacity in English law]]</ref>\\n\\nEach contractual party must be a \\\"competent person\\\" having legal capacity. The parties may be natural persons  (\\\"individuals\\\") or [[Legal personality|juristic person]]s (\\\"[[corporation]]s\\\"). An agreement is formed when an \\\"offer\\\" is accepted. The parties must have an [[intention to be legally bound]]; and to be valid, the agreement must have both proper [[Formalities in English law|\\\"form\\\"]] and a lawful object.  In [[England]] (and in [[jurisdiction]]s using English contract principles), the parties must also exchange \\\"[[Consideration in English law|consideration]]\\\" to create a \\\"mutuality of obligation,\\\" as in [[Semble#law|Simpkins v Pays]].<ref>[http://contracts.uslegal.com/elements-of-a-contract/ Elements of a Contract - Contracts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\\n\\nIn the United States, persons under 18 are typically [[Minor (law)|minor]] and their contracts are considered [[voidable]]; however, if the minor voids the contract, benefits received by the minor must be returned.

English courts may weigh the emphasis or relative knowledge in determining whether a statement is enforceable as part of the contract. In the English case of ''Bannerman v White''<ref>''Bannerman v White'' [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1861/713.pdf <nowiki>[1861]</nowiki> EngR 713]; (1861) 10 CBNS 844, Court of Common Pleas (United Kingdom).</ref> the court upheld a rejection by a buyer of hops which had been treated with sulphur since the buyer explicitly expressed the importance of this requirement. The relative knowledge of the parties may also be a factor, as in English case of ''Bissett v Wilkinson''<ref name=\\\"Bissett v Wilkinson\\\">''Bissett v Wilkinson'' [1927] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 177.</ref> where the court did not find misrepresentation when a seller said that farmland being sold would carry 2000 sheep if worked by one team; the buyer was considered sufficiently knowledgeable to accept or reject the seller's opinion.\\n\\n===Standard terms and contracts of adhesion===\\n[[Standard form contract]]s contain \\\"[[Boilerplate clause|boilerplate]]\\\", which is a set of \\\"[[one size fits all]]\\\" contract provisions. However, the term may also narrowly refer to conditions at the end of the contract which specify the governing law provision, venue, assignment and delegation, waiver of jury trial, notice, and [[force majeure]].

Implied terms are not stated but nevertheless form a provision of the contract.\\n\\n====Terms implied in fact====\\nTerms may be implied due to the factual circumstances or conduct of the parties. In the case of ''[[BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings]]'',<ref name=\\\"BP Refinery\\\"/> the UK [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]], on appeal from Australia, proposed a five-stage test to determine situations where the facts of a case may imply terms. The classic tests have been the \\\"business efficacy test\\\" and the \\\"officious bystander test\\\". Under the \\\"business efficacy test\\\" first proposed in ''[[The Moorcock]]'' [1889], the minimum terms necessary to give business efficacy to the contract will be implied. Under the officious bystander test (named in ''[[Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd v Shirlaw]]'' [1940] but actually originating in ''Reigate v. Union Manufacturing Co (Ramsbottom) Ltd'' [1918]), a term can only be implied in fact if an \\\"officious bystander\\\" listening to the contract negotiations suggested that the term be included the parties would promptly agree. The difference between these tests is questionable.\\n\\n====Terms implied in law====\\n[[Statute]]s or [[common law|judicial rulings]] may create implied contractual terms, particularly in standardized relationships such as employment or shipping contracts. The Uniform Commercial Code of the United States also imposes an [[implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing]] in performance and enforcement of contracts covered by the Code. In addition, [[Australia]], [[Israel]] and [[India]] imply a similar good faith term through laws.\\n\\nIn England, some contracts (insurance and partnerships) require [[Uberrima fides|utmost good faith]], while others may require [[Good faith (law)|good faith]] (employment contracts and agency). Most English contracts do '''not''' need any good faith, provided that the law is met. There is, however, an overarching concept of \\\"[[legitimate expectation]]\\\".\\n\\nMost [[Country|countries]] have statutes which deal directly with sale of goods, lease transactions, and trade practices. In the United States, prominent examples include, in the case of products, an implied [[warranty]] of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, and in the case of homes an implied warranty of habitability.\\n\\nIn the United Kingdom, implied terms may be created by:\\n* Statute, such as the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]], the [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]] and the [[Hague-Visby Rules]];\\n* Common Law, such as ''[[The Moorcock]]'',<ref>''[[The Moorcock]]'' (1889) 14 PD 64.</ref> which introduced the \\\"business efficacy\\\" test;\\n* Previous Dealings, as in [[J Spurling Ltd v Bradshaw|''Spurling v Bradshaw'']].<ref>{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[J Spurling Ltd v Bradshaw]] |year=1956 |court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=3 |parallelcite=[1956] 2 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 121 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\\n* Custom, as in ''[[Hutton v Warren]]''.<ref>''[[Hutton v Warren]]'' [1836] M&W 466.</ref>\\n\\n====Terms implied by custom====\\nA term may be implied on the basis of custom or usage in a particular market or context.

For example, under certain circumstances, false statements or promises made by a seller of goods regarding the quality or nature of the product that the seller has may constitute misrepresentation. A finding of misrepresentation allows for a remedy of rescission and sometimes damages depending on the type of misrepresentation.\\n\\nIn a court of law, to prove misrepresentation and/or fraud, there must be evidence that shows a claim was made, said claim was false, the party making the claim knew the claim was false, and that party's intention was for a transaction to occur based upon the false claim.<ref name=\\\":1\\\">{{Cite book|last=Knapp|first=Charles|title=Problems in Contract Law: Cases and Materials|last2=Crystal|first2=Nathan|last3=Prince|first3=Harry|publisher=Aspen Publishers/Wolters Kluwer Law & Business|year=2007|isbn=|edition=4th|location=|pages=659}}</ref>\\n\\nThere are two types of misrepresentation: fraud in the factum and fraud in inducement. Fraud in the factum focuses on whether the party alleging misrepresentation knew they were creating a contract.

Fraud in inducement focuses on misrepresentation attempting to get the party to enter into the contract. Misrepresentation of a material fact (if the party knew the truth, that party would not have entered into the contract) makes a contract voidable.\\n\\nAssume two people, Party A and Party B, enter into a contract.

See ''[[Raffles v Wichelhaus]]''.<ref>''[[Raffles v Wichelhaus]]'' (1864) 2 Hurl. & C. 906.</ref>\\n*'''Unilateral mistake''' occurs when only one party to a contract is mistaken as to the terms or subject-matter. The courts will uphold such a contract unless it was determined that the non-mistaken party was aware of the mistake and tried to take advantage of the mistake.<ref>[[Smith v. Hughes]] [1871].</ref><ref name=\\\"Taylor v Johnson\\\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|5|1983|litigants=[[Taylor v Johnson]] |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.</ref> It is also possible for a contract to be void if there was a mistake in the identity of the contracting party. An example is in ''Lewis v Avery''<ref>{{cite BAILII|court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=4 |year=1971 |litigants=Lewis v Avery |parallelcite=[1971] 3 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 907 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> where [[Lord Denning|Lord Denning MR]] held that the contract can only be voided if the plaintiff can show that, at the time of agreement, the plaintiff believed the other party's identity was of vital importance. A mere mistaken belief as to the credibility of the other party is not sufficient.\\n\\n===Duress and undue influence===\\n{{Main|Duress (contract law)|Undue influence}}\\nDuress has been defined as a \\\"threat of harm made to compel a person to do something against his or her will or judgment; esp., a wrongful threat made by one person to compel a manifestation of seeming assent by another person to a transaction without real volition.\\\"<ref>[[Black's Law Dictionary]] (8th ed. 2004)</ref> An example is in ''[[Barton v Armstrong]]'' [1976] in a person was threatened with death if they did not sign the contract. An innocent party wishing to set aside a contract for duress to the person need only to prove that the threat was made and that it was a reason for entry into the contract; the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] then shifts to the other party to prove that the threat had no effect in causing the party to enter into the contract. There can also be duress to goods and sometimes, 'economic duress'.\\n\\nUndue influence is an equitable doctrine that involves one person taking advantage of a position of power over another person through a special relationship such as between parent and child or solicitor and client. As an equitable doctrine, the court has discretion. When no special relationship exists, the question is whether there was a relationship of such trust and confidence that it should give rise to such a presumption.<ref>{{cite AustLII|HCA|41|1936|litigants=[[Johnson v Buttress]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1936/41.pdf (1936) 56 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 113] |courtname=auto |date=17 August 1936}}.</ref><ref>See also {{cite AustLII|VicRp|29|1982|litigants=Westmelton (Vic) Pty Ltd v Archer and Shulman |parallecite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.</ref><ref>''Odorizzi v.

However, the agreement was unenforceable as it was intended to \\\"stifle a criminal prosecution\\\", and the bank was forced to return the payments made by the husband.\\n\\nIn the U.S., one unusual type of unenforceable contract is a personal [[employment]] contract to work as a spy or secret agent. This is because the very secrecy of the contract is a condition of the contract (in order to maintain [[plausible deniability]]). If the spy subsequently sues the government on the contract over issues like salary or benefits, then the spy has breached the contract by revealing its existence. It is thus unenforceable on that ground, as well as the public policy of maintaining [[national security]] (since a disgruntled agent might try to reveal ''all'' the government's secrets during his/her lawsuit).<ref>''[[Tenet v. Doe]]'', {{ussc|544|1|2005}}.</ref>  Other types of unenforceable employment contracts include contracts agreeing to work for less than [[minimum wage]] and forfeiting the right to [[workman's compensation]] in cases where workman's compensation is due.\\n\\n===Remedies for defendant on defenses===\\n\\n====Setting aside the contract====\\nThere can be four different ways in which contracts can be set aside. A contract may be deemed '[[void (law)|void]]', '[[voidable]]', '[[unenforceable]]' or 'ineffective'. Voidness implies that a contract never came into existence. Voidability implies that one or both parties may declare a contract ineffective at their wish. Kill fees are paid by magazine publishers to authors when their articles are submitted on time but are subsequently not used for publication. When this occurs, the magazine cannot claim copyright for the \\\"killed\\\" assignment. Unenforceability implies that neither party may have recourse to a court for a remedy. Ineffectiveness implies that the contract terminates by order of a court where a public body has failed to satisfy [[public procurement]] law. To [[Rescission (contract law)|rescind]] is to set aside or unmake a contract.\\n\\n==Disputes==\\n===Procedure===\\n{{Main|Civil procedure}}\\nIn many countries, in order to obtain damages for breach of contract or to obtain specific performance or other equitable relief, the aggrieved injured party may file a civil (non-criminal) lawsuit in court.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Farnsworth|first1=E.

Likewise, in the United States, an aggrieved party may apply for injunctive relief to prevent a threatened breach of contract, where such breach would result in irreparable harm that could not be adequately remedied by money damages.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rowan|first1=Sol\\u00e8ne|title=Remedies for Breach of Contract: A Comparative Analysis of the Protection of Performance|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199606603|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TofAQAAQBAJ|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref>\\n\\n====Arbitration====\\nIf the contract contains a valid [[arbitration]] clause then, prior to filing a lawsuit, the aggrieved party must submit an arbitration claim in accordance with the procedures set forth in the clause. Many contracts provide that all disputes arising thereunder will be resolved by arbitration, rather than litigated in courts.  <ref> www.russolaw-llc.com </ref>\\n\\nArbitration judgments may generally be enforced in the same manner as ordinary court judgments, and are recognized and enforceable internationally under the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention]], which has 156 parties. However, in New York Convention states, arbitral decisions are generally immune unless there is a showing that the arbitrator's decision was irrational or tainted by [[fraud]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=A.A.|title=Circumventing the Supremacy Clause - Understanding the Constitutional Implications of the United States' Treatment of Treaty Obligations through an Analysis of the New York Convention|journal=San Diego International Law Journal|date=2005|volume=7|page=491|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/sdintl7&div=24&id=&page=|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref>\\n\\nSome arbitration clauses are not enforceable, and in other cases arbitration may not be sufficient to resolve a legal dispute.

In the absence of a [[choice of law clause]], the court will normally apply either the law of the forum or the law of the jurisdiction that has the strongest connection to the subject matter of the contract. A choice of law clause allows the parties to agree in advance that their contract will be interpreted under the laws of a specific jurisdiction.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Common Contract Clauses|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/contract_clauses.html#choice-of-law-and-forum-clause|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=10 October 2017|date=22 July 2016}}</ref>\\n\\nWithin the United States, choice of law clauses are generally enforceable, although exceptions based upon public policy may at times apply.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Healy|first1=James J.|title=Consumer Protection Choice of Law: European Lessons for the United States|journal=Duke Journal of Comparative & International Law|date=2008|volume=19|page=535|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1284&context=djcil|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref> Within the European Union, even when the parties have negotiated a choice of law clause, conflict of law issues may be governed by the [[Rome I Regulation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32008R0593|website=Eur-Lex|accessdate=10 October 2017|date=17 June 2008}}</ref>\\n\\n====Choice of forum====\\nMany contracts contain a [[forum selection clause]] setting out where disputes in relation to the contract should be litigated. The clause may be general, requiring that any case arising from the contract be filed within a specific state or country, or it may require that a case be filed in a specific court. For example, a choice of forum clause may require that a case be filed in the U.S. State of California, or it may require more specifically that the case be filed in the Superior Court for Los Angeles County.\\n\\nA choice of law or venue is not necessarily binding upon a court. Based upon an analysis of the laws, rules of procedure and public policy of the state and court in which the case was filed, a court that is identified by the clause may find that it should not exercise jurisdiction, or a court in a different jurisdiction or venue may find that the litigation may proceed despite the clause.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://guides.lib.monash.edu/commercial-law/contract-law|title=Commercial law: Contract law|last=|first=|date=|website=Monash University|access-date=}}</ref> As part of that analysis, a court may examine whether the clause conforms with the formal requirements of the jurisdiction in which the case was filed (in some jurisdictions a choice of forum or choice of venue clause only limits the parties if the word \\\"exclusive\\\" is explicitly included in the clause). Some jurisdictions will not accept an action that has no connection to the court that was chosen, and others will not enforce a choice of venue clause when they consider themselves to be a more [[forum non conveniens|convenient forum]] for the litigation.<ref>See, e.g., {{cite journal|last1=Mullenix|first1=Linda A.|title=Another Choice of Forum, Another Choice of Law: Consensual Adjudicatory Procedure in Federal Court|journal=Fordham Law Review|date=1988|volume=57|page=291|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/flr57&div=20&id=&page=|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref>\\n\\nSome contracts are governed by multilateral instruments that require a non-chosen court to dismiss cases and require the recognition of judgments made by courts having jurisdiction based on a choice of court clause. For example, the [[Brussels regime]] instruments (31 European states) and the [[Hague Choice of Court Agreements Convention]] (European Union, Mexico, Montenegro, Singapore), as well as several instruments related to a specific area of law, may require courts to enforce and recognize choice of law clauses and foreign judgments.\\n\\n===Remedies===\\n{{Main|Breach of contract}}\\nIn the United Kingdom, breach of contract is defined in the [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]] as:  [i] non-performance, [ ii] poor performance, [iii] part-performance, or [iv] performance which is substantially different from what was reasonably expected.  Innocent parties may repudiate (cancel) the contract only for a major breach (breach of condition),<ref>[[Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd]] [1962] 1 All ER 474; see also {{cite AustLII|HCA|24|1951|litigants=Associated Newspapers Ltd v Bancks |parallelcite=(1951) 83 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 322 |courtname=auto}}.</ref><ref>The Mihailis Angelos [1971] 1 QB 164</ref> but they may always recover compensatory damages, provided that the breach has caused foreseeable loss.\\n\\nIt was not possible to sue [[the Crown]] in the UK for breach of contract before 1948. However, it was appreciated that contractors might be reluctant to deal on such a basis and claims were entertained under a [[petition of right]] that needed to be endorsed by the [[Home Secretary]] and [[Attorney-General]]. S.1 [[Crown Proceedings Act 1947]] opened the Crown to ordinary contractual claims through the courts as for any other person.\\n\\n====Damages====\\n{{Main|Damages}}\\nThere are several different types of damages.\\n*Compensatory damages, which are given to the party injured by the breach of contract. With compensatory damages, there are two [[heads of loss]], consequential damage and direct damage. In theory, compensatory damages are designed to put the injured party in his or her rightful position, usually through an award of expectation damages.\\n*Liquidated damages are an estimate of loss agreed to in the contract, so that the court avoids calculating compensatory damages and the parties have greater certainty. Liquidated damages clauses may be called \\\"penalty clauses\\\" in ordinary language, but the law distinguishes between liquidated damages (legitimate) and penalties (invalid). A test for determining which category a clause falls into was established by the English House of Lords in ''[[Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage & Motor Co Ltd]]''<ref>{{cite BAILII |year=1914 |court=UKHL |num=1 |litigants=[[Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage & Motor Co Ltd]] |parallelcite=[1915] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 79 at 86 per Lord Dunedin |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\\n*Nominal damages consist of a small cash amount where the court concludes that the defendant is in breach but the plaintiff has suffered no quantifiable pecuniary loss, and may be sought to obtain a legal record of who was at fault.\\n*Punitive or exemplary damages are used to punish the party at fault; but even though such damages are not intended primarily to compensate, nevertheless the claimant (and not the state) receives the award.  Exemplary damages are not recognised nor permitted in some jurisdictions.  In the UK, exemplary damages are not available for breach of contract, but are possible after fraud.  Although vitiating factors (such as misrepresentation, mistake, undue influence and duress) relate to contracts, they are not contractual actions, and so, in a roundabout way, a claimant in contract may be able to get exemplary damages.\\n\\nCompensatory damages compensate the plaintiff for actual losses suffered as accurately as possible.  They may be \\\"expectation damages\\\", \\\"reliance damages\\\" or \\\"[[restitution]]ary damages\\\".  Expectation damages are awarded to put the party in as good of a position as the party would have been in had the contract been performed as promised.<ref>{{cite AustLII|HCA|36|1954|litigants=Bellgrove v Eldridge |parallelcite=(1954) 90 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 613 |date=20 August 1954 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>  Reliance damages are usually awarded where no reasonably reliable estimate of expectation loss can be arrived at or at the option of the plaintiff. Reliance losses cover expense suffered in reliance to the promise. Examples where reliance damages have been awarded because profits are too speculative include the Australian case of ''[[McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission]]''<ref name=\\\"McRae v Commonwealth\\\"/> which concerned a contract for the rights to salvage a ship. In ''Anglia Television Ltd v. Reed''<ref>[1972] 1 QB 60</ref> the English Court of Appeal awarded the plaintiff expenditures incurred prior to the contract in preparation of performance.\\n\\nAfter a breach has occurred, the innocent party has a duty to mitigate loss by taking any reasonable steps.  Failure to mitigate means that damages may be reduced or even denied altogether.<ref>The [[Uniform Commercial Code|UCC]] states, \\\"Consequential damages... include any loss... which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise.\\\" UCC 2-715.In English law the chief authority on mitigation is ''British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co v Underground Electric Railway Co of London''[1912] AC 673, see especially 689 per Lord Haldane.</ref> However, Professor Michael Furmston <ref>M.P. Furmston, ''Cheshire, Fifoot & Furmston's Law of Contract'', 15th edn (OUP: Oxford, 2007) p.779.</ref> has argued that \\\"it is wrong to express (the mitigation) rule by stating that the plaintiff is under a duty to mitigate his loss\\\",<ref>M.P. Furmston, ''Cheshire, Fifoot & Furmston's Law of Contract'', 15th edn (OUP: Oxford, 2007) p.779 n.130.</ref> citing ''Sotiros Shipping Inc v Sameiet, The Solholt''.<ref>''Sotiros Shipping Inc v Sameiet, The Solholt'' [1983] 1 Lloyd's Rep 605.</ref> If a party provides notice that the contract will not be completed, an [[anticipatory breach]] occurs.\\n\\nDamages may be general or consequential. General damages are those damages which naturally flow from a breach of contract. Consequential damages are those damages which, although not naturally flowing from a breach, are naturally supposed by both parties at the time of contract formation. An example would be when someone rents a car to get to a business meeting, but when that person arrives to pick up the car, it is not there. General damages would be the cost of renting a different car. Consequential damages would be the lost business if that person was unable to get to the meeting, if both parties knew the reason the party was renting the car. However, there is still a duty to mitigate the losses. The fact that the car was not there does not give the party a right to not attempt to rent another car.\\n\\nTo recover damages, a claimant must show that the breach of contract caused foreseeable loss.<ref name=\\\"Hadley v Baxendale\\\"/><ref>See also ''Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corp Ltd'' (1987) 9 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 310.</ref> ''[[Hadley v Baxendale]]'' established that the test of foreseeability is both objective or subjective.  In other words, is it foreseeable to the objective bystander, or to the contracting parties, who may have special knowledge?  On the facts of this case, where a miller lost production because a carrier delayed taking broken mill parts for repair, the court held that no damages were payable since the loss was foreseeable neither by the \\\"reasonable man\\\" nor by the carrier, both of whom would have expected the miller to have a spare part in store.\\n\\n====Specific performance====\\n{{Main|Specific performance}}\\nThere may be circumstances in which it would be unjust to permit the defaulting party simply to buy out the injured party with damages. For example, where an art collector purchases a rare painting and the vendor refuses to deliver, the collector's damages would be equal to the sum paid.\\n\\nThe court may make an order of what is called \\\"specific performance\\\", requiring that the contract be performed. In some circumstances a court will order a party to perform his or her promise (an order of \\\"[[specific performance]]\\\") or issue an order, known as an \\\"injunction\\\", that a party refrain from doing something that would breach the contract. A specific performance is obtainable for the breach of a contract to sell land or real estate on such grounds that the property has a unique value. In the [[United States]] by way of the [[13th Amendment to the United States Constitution]], specific performance in personal service contracts is only legal \\\"''as punishment for a crime whereof the criminal shall be dully convicted''.\\\"<ref>{{cite web | title = 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution | url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.amendmentxiii.html | accessdate = 2008-10-10}}</ref>\\n\\nBoth an order for specific performance and an injunction are discretionary remedies, originating for the most part in [[Equity (law)|equity]]. Neither is available as of right and in most jurisdictions and most circumstances a court will not normally order specific performance. A contract for the sale of real property is a notable exception. In most jurisdictions, the sale of real property is enforceable by specific performance. Even in this case the defenses to an action in equity (such as [[Laches (equity)|laches]], the ''bona fide'' purchaser rule, or [[unclean hands]]) may act as a bar to specific performance.\\n\\nRelated to orders for specific performance, an injunction may be requested when the contract prohibits a certain action. Action for injunction would prohibit the person from performing the act specified in the contract.\\n\\n==History==\\n{{main|History of contract law|Roman law}}\\n\\nWhilst early rules of trade and barter have existed since ancient times, modern laws of contract in the West are traceable from the industrial revolution (1750 onwards), when increasing numbers worked in factories for a cash wage.  In particular, the growing strength of the British economy and the adaptability and flexibility of the [[English law|English common law]] led to a swift development of English<ref>as opposed to Scottish law</ref> contract law, while the more rigid civil law in Europe lagged behind.<ref>In 1789, while the French were engaged in their revolution, the English law was busying itself in defining the rules of auctions: see [[Payne v Cave]]</ref> Colonies within the British empire (including the [[United States|USA]] and [[Dominion|the Dominions]]) would [[Reception statute|adopt the law]] of the mother country.  Civil law countries (especially Germany) later developed their own brand of contract law.  In the 20th century, the growth of export trade led to countries adopting international conventions, such as the [[Hague-Visby Rules]] and the [[United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods|UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods]],<ref>Willmott, L, Christensen, S, Butler, D, & Dixon, B 2009 ''Contract Law'', Third Edition, Oxford University Press, North Melbourne</ref> to promote uniform regulations.\\n\\n[[File:Bill of sale Louvre AO3765.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Bill of sale]] of a male slave and a building in Shuruppak, [[Sumer]]ian tablet, circa 2600 BC]]\\nContract law is based on the principle expressed in the [[Latin]] phrase ''[[pacta sunt servanda]],'' ( \\\"agreements must be kept\\\").<ref>[[Hans Wehberg]], ''[[Pacta Sunt Servanda]],'' [[The American Journal of International Law]], Vol. 53, No. 4 (Oct., 1959), [http://www.trans-lex.org/129500 p.775.]; Trans-Lex.org [http://www.trans-lex.org/919000 Principle of Sanctity of contracts]</ref> The common law of contract originated with the now-defuct writ of [[assumpsit]], which was originally a [[tort]] action based on reliance.<ref>Atiyah PS.

In common law jurisdictions such as  England and the United States, a high degree of freedom is the norm. For example, in [[Law of the United States|American law]], it was determined in the 1901 case of ''[[Hurley v. Eddingfield]]'' that a physician was permitted to deny treatment to a patient despite the lack of other available medical assistance and the patient's subsequent death.<ref>Blake V. (2012).

Other legal systems such as Islamic law, socialist legal systems, and customary law have their own variations.\\n\\nHowever, in both the [[European union]] and the United States, the need to prevent discrimination has eroded the full extent of freedom of contract. Legislation governing equality, equal pay, racial discrimination, disability discrimination and so on, has imposed limits of the full freedom of contract.<ref name=Bernstein/> For example, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] restricted private racial discrimination against African-Americans.<ref>Douglas D.

In 1993, [[Harvey McGregor]], a British barrister and academic, produced a \\\"Contract Code\\\" under the auspices of the English and Scottish [[Law Commission]]s, which was a proposal to both unify and codify the contract laws of England and Scotland. This document was offered as a possible \\\"Contract Code for Europe\\\", but tensions between English and German jurists meant that this proposal has so far come to naught.<ref>... indeed the Code was neither published nor adopted by the UK, instead being privately published by an Italian University</ref>\\n\\n==Contract theory==\\nContract theory is the body of legal theory that addresses normative and conceptual questions in contract law. One of the most important questions asked in contract theory is why contracts are enforced. One prominent answer to this question focuses on the economic benefits of enforcing bargains. Another approach, associated with [[Charles Fried]], maintains that the purpose of contract law is to enforce promises. This theory is developed in Fried's book, ''Contract as Promise.'' Other approaches to contract theory are found in the writings of [[legal realism|legal realists]] and [[critical legal studies]] theorists.\\n\\nMore generally, writers have propounded [[Marxist]] and feminist interpretations of contract.  Attempts at overarching understandings of the purpose and nature of contract as a phenomenon have been made, notably [[Relational contract|relational contract theory]] originally developed by U.S. contracts scholars [[Ian Roderick Macneil]] and Stewart Macaulay, building at least in part on the contract theory work of U.S. scholar [[Lon L. Fuller]], while U.S. scholars have been at the forefront of developing economic theories of contract focussing on questions of [[transaction cost]] and so-called '[[efficient breach]]' theory.\\n\\nAnother dimension of the theoretical debate in contract is its place within, and relationship to a wider [[law of obligations]]. Obligations have traditionally been divided into contracts, which are voluntarily undertaken and owed to a specific person or persons, and obligations in [[tort]] which are based on the wrongful infliction of harm to certain protected interests, primarily imposed by the law, and typically owed to a wider class of persons.\\n\\nRecently it has been accepted that there is a third category, restitutionary obligations, based on the [[unjust enrichment]] of the defendant at the plaintiff's expense. Contractual liability, reflecting the constitutive function of contract, is generally for failing to make things better (by not rendering the expected performance), liability in tort is generally for action (as opposed to omission) making things worse, and liability in restitution is for unjustly taking or retaining the benefit of the plaintiff's money or work.<ref>Beatson, ''Anson's Law of Contract'' (1998) 27th ed.

This is typically reached through offer and an acceptance which does not vary the offer's terms, which is known as the \\\"[[mirror image rule]]\\\". An offer is a definite statement of the offeror's willingness to be bound should certain conditions be met.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of Irish Contract Law|last=Enright|first=M\\u00e1ir\\u00e9ad|publisher=Clarus Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> If a purported acceptance does vary the terms of an offer, it is not an acceptance but a counteroffer and, therefore, simultaneously a rejection of the original offer. The [[Uniform Commercial Code]] disposes of the mirror image rule in \\u00a72-207, although the UCC only governs transactions in goods in the USA. As a court cannot read minds, the intent of the parties is interpreted [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectively]] from the perspective of a [[reasonable person]],<ref>DiMatteo L. (1997). [http://www.cisg.law.pace.edu/cisg/biblio/dimatteo5.html The Counterpoise of Contracts: The Reasonable Person Standard and the Subjectivity of Judgment]. ''South Carolina Law Review''.</ref> as determined in the early English case of ''[[Smith v Hughes]]'' [1871]. It is important to note that where an offer specifies a particular mode of acceptance, only an acceptance communicated via that method will be valid.<ref>{{cite AustLII|HCA|10|1973|litigants=George Hudson Holdings Ltd v Rudder (1973) 128 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 387 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\\n\\n<!--  Commented out: [[File:Parkingticketcontract.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Unilateral contract of adhesion on timekeeping ticket dispensed by vending machine at parking lot entrance {{pufc|Parkingticketcontract.jpg}}]] -->\\nContracts may be [[wikt:Bilateral|bilateral]] or [[unilateral]]. A bilateral contract is an agreement in which each of the parties to the contract makes a [[promise]]<ref>[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/promise promise legal definition of promise. promise synonyms by the Free Online Law Dictionary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  or set of promises to each other. For example, in a contract for the sale of a home, the buyer promises to pay the seller $200,000 in exchange for the seller's promise to deliver title to the property. These common contracts take place in the daily flow of [[commerce]] transactions, and in cases with sophisticated or expensive [[condition precedent|precedent]] requirements, which are requirements that must be met for the contract to be fulfilled.\\n\\nLess common are unilateral contracts in which one party makes a promise, but the other side does not promise anything. In these cases, those accepting the offer are not required to communicate their acceptance to the offeror. In a reward contract, for example, a person who has lost a dog could promise a reward if the dog is found, through publication or orally. The payment could be additionally conditioned on the dog being returned alive. Those who learn of the reward are not required to search for the dog, but if someone finds the dog and delivers it, the promisor is required to pay. In the similar case of advertisements of deals or bargains, a general rule is that these are not contractual offers but merely an \\\"invitation to treat\\\" (or bargain), but the applicability of this rule is disputed and contains various exceptions.<ref>Feinman JM, Brill SR. (2006). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=943315&download=yes Is an Advertisement an Offer? Why it is, and Why it Matters]. ''Hastings Law Journal''.</ref> The High Court of Australia stated that the term unilateral contract is \\\"unscientific and misleading\\\".<ref>Wilmot et al, 2009, ''Contract Law'', Third Edition, Oxford University Press, page 34</ref>\\n\\nIn certain circumstances, an [[implied contract]] may be created. A contract is [[implied in fact contract|implied in fact]] if the circumstances imply that parties have reached an agreement even though they have not done so expressly. For example, John Smith, a former lawyer may implicitly enter a contract by visiting a doctor and being examined; if the patient refuses to pay after being examined, the patient has [[Breach of contract|breached a contract]] implied in fact. A contract which is [[implied in law contract|implied in law]] is also called a [[quasi-contract]], because it is not in fact a contract; rather, it is a means for the [[court]]s to remedy situations in which one party would be [[Unjust enrichment|unjustly enriched]] were he or she not required to compensate the other. [[Quantum meruit]] claims are an example.\\n\\n===Invitation to treat===\\n{{Main|Invitation to treat}}\\nWhere something is advertised in a newspaper or on a poster, the advertisement will not normally constitute an offer but will instead be an [[invitation to treat]], an indication that one or both parties are prepared to negotiate a deal.<ref>''[[Partridge v Crittenden]]'' [1968] 1 WLR 1204</ref><ref>[http://www.lexisnexis.com.wwwproxy0.library.unsw.edu.au/au/legal/search/casessubmitForm.do ''Harris v Nickerson'' (1873) LR8QB 286]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>''Household Fire Insurance v Grant'' 1879</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Carbolic smoke ball co.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|The Carbolic Smoke Ball offer]]\\nAn exception arises if the advertisement makes a unilateral promise, such as the offer of a reward, as in the famous case of ''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co]]'',<ref>{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co]] |parallelcite=[1893] 2 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 256 |year=1892 |court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=1 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> decided in [[Victorian era|nineteenth-century England]]. The company, a pharmaceutical manufacturer, advertised a smoke ball that would, if sniffed \\\"three times daily for two weeks\\\", prevent users from catching the [[Influenza|'flu]]. If the [[Panacea (medicine)|smoke ball]] failed to prevent 'flu, the company promised that they would pay the user [[pound sterling|\\u00a3]]100, adding that they had \\\"deposited \\u00a31,000 in the Alliance Bank to show our sincerity in the matter\\\". When Mrs Carlill sued for the money, the company argued the advert should not be taken as a serious, [[legally binding]] [[Offer and Acceptance|offer]]; instead it was a [[gimmick|\\\"mere puff\\\"]]; but the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] held that it would appear to a [[reasonable man]] that Carbolic had made a serious offer, and determined that the reward was a contractual promise.\\n\\nAlthough an invitation to treat cannot be accepted, it should not be ignored, for it may nevertheless affect the offer.  For instance, where an offer is made in response to an invitation to <span lang=\\\"simple\\\">treat</span>, the offer may incorporate the terms of the invitation to treat (unless the offer expressly incorporates different terms).  If, as in the ''Boots case'',<ref>[http://legal.thomsonreuters.com.au/product/AU/files/720502512/pharmaceutical_society_of_great_britian_v_boots_cash_chemists.pdf ''Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v.

Until the announcement is made any bidder may retract his bid.\\\"\\n\\n====Electronic contracts====\\nEntry into contracts online has become common. Many jurisdictions have passed e-signature laws that have made the electronic contract and signature as legally valid as a paper contract.\\n\\nIn India, E-contracts are governed by the Indian Contract Act (1872), according to which certain conditions need to be fulfilled while formulating a valid contact. Certain sections in information Technology Act (2000) also provide for validity of online contract.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Linstone|first1=Harold A.|title=Understanding Electronic Contracts - The Indian Law of Contract|url=http://www.nalsarpro.org/CL/Modules/Module%201/Chapter3.pdf|website=Nalsar Pro|accessdate=3 April 2018|date=9 April 2013}}</ref>\\n\\nIn some U.S. states, email exchanges have become binding contracts. New York courts in 2016 held that the principles of real estate contracts to apply equally to electronic communications and electronic signatures, so long as \\u201cits contents and subscription meet all requirements of the governing statute\\u201d and pursuant to the Electronic Signatures and Records Act (ESRA).<ref>{{cite web|title=''Stonehill Capital Management LLC v.

For example, in ''[[Rose & Frank Co v JR Crompton & Bros Ltd]]'', an agreement between two business parties was not enforced because an \\\"honour clause\\\" in the document stated \\\"this is not a commercial or legal agreement, but is only a statement of the intention of the parties\\\".\\n\\nIn contrast, domestic and social agreements such as those between children and parents are typically unenforceable on the basis of [[public policy]]. For example, in the English case ''[[Balfour v. Balfour]]'' a husband agreed to give his wife \\u00a330 a month while he was away from home, but the court refused to enforce the agreement when the husband stopped paying. In contrast, in ''[[Merritt v Merritt]]'' the court enforced an agreement between an estranged couple because the circumstances suggested their agreement was intended to have legal consequences.\\n\\n===Consideration===\\n{{Main|Consideration}}\\nA concept of English common law, [[consideration]]  is required for simple contracts but not for special contracts (contracts by [[deed]]).  The court in ''Currie v Misa'' <ref>''Currie v Misa''  (1875)  LR 10 Ex 893</ref> declared consideration to be a \\u201cRight,  Interest,  Profit,  Benefit, or Forbearance,  Detriment,  Loss,  Responsibility\\u201d. Thus, consideration is a promise of something of value given by a promissor in exchange for something of value given by a promisee; and typically the thing of value is goods, money, or an act. Forbearance to act, such as an adult promising to refrain from smoking, is enforceable '''only''' if one is thereby surrendering a legal right.<ref>''Wade v Simeon'' (1846)  2 CB 548</ref><ref>''White v Bluett''  (1853)  2 WR 75</ref><ref>Bronaugh R.

Atiyah, 'Consideration: A Restatement' in ''Essays on Contract'' (1986) p.195, Oxford University Press</ref> However, [[legislation]], rather than judicial development, has been touted as the only way to remove this entrenched common law doctrine. [[Lord Denning|Lord Justice Denning]] famously stated that \\\"The doctrine of consideration is too firmly fixed to be overthrown by a side-wind.\\\"<ref name=\\\"High Trees\\\">{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd]] |year=2007 |court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=1329 |parallelcite=[1947] [[Kings Bench|KB]] 130 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> In the United States, the emphasis has shifted to the process of bargaining as exemplified by ''[[Hamer v. Sidway]]'' (1891).\\n\\nCourts will typically not weigh the \\\"adequacy\\\" of consideration provided the consideration is determined to be \\\"sufficient\\\", with sufficiency defined as meeting the test of law, whereas \\\"adequacy\\\" is the subjective fairness or equivalence. For instance, agreeing to sell a car for a penny may constitute a binding contract<ref>''[[Chappell & Co Ltd v. Nestle Co Ltd]]'' [1959] 2 All ER 701 in which the wrappers from three chocolate bars was held to be part of the consideration for the sale and purchase of a musical recording.</ref> (although if the transaction is an attempt to avoid tax, it will be treated by the tax authority as though a market price had been paid).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/frequently-asked-questions-on-gift-taxes#2|title=Frequently Asked Questions on Gift Taxes|website=www.irs.gov|access-date=2016-05-26}}</ref> Parties may do this for tax purposes, attempting to disguise gift transactions as contracts.

For example, in the early English case of ''Eastwood v. Kenyon'' [1840], the guardian  of a young girl took out a loan to educate her. After she was married, her husband promised to pay the debt but the loan was determined to be past consideration. The insufficiency of past consideration is related to the ''[[pre-existing duty rule]]''. In the early English case of ''[[Stilk v. Myrick]]'' [1809], a captain promised to divide the wages of two deserters among the remaining crew if they agreed to sail home short-handed; however, this promise was found unenforceable as the crew were already contracted to sail the ship. The pre-existing duty rule also extends to general legal duties; for example, a promise to refrain from committing a tort or crime is not sufficient.<ref>''Collins v. Godefroy'' (1831) 1 B. & Ad. 950.</ref>\\n\\n==Capacity==\\n{{Main|Capacity (law)}}\\nSometimes the capacity of either [[natural person|natural]] or [[Legal person|artificial]] persons to either enforce contracts, or have contracts enforced against them is restricted. For instance, very small children may not be held to bargains they have made, on the assumption that they lack the maturity to understand what they are doing; errant employees or directors may be prevented from contracting for their company, because they have acted ''[[ultra vires]]'' (beyond their power). Another example might be people who are mentally incapacitated, either by disability or drunkenness.<ref>see for a discussion of the position in English law, the [[Capacity in English law#lackofcapacity intoxication2016-07-24|article on Capacity in English law]]</ref>\\n\\nEach contractual party must be a \\\"competent person\\\" having legal capacity. The parties may be natural persons  (\\\"individuals\\\") or [[Legal personality|juristic person]]s (\\\"[[corporation]]s\\\"). An agreement is formed when an \\\"offer\\\" is accepted.

Representations, which are often precontractual, are typically less strictly enforced than terms, and material misrepresentations historically was a cause of action for the [[tort of deceit]].

English courts may weigh the emphasis or relative knowledge in determining whether a statement is enforceable as part of the contract. In the English case of ''Bannerman v White''<ref>''Bannerman v White'' [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1861/713.pdf <nowiki>[1861]</nowiki> EngR 713]; (1861) 10 CBNS 844, Court of Common Pleas (United Kingdom).</ref> the court upheld a rejection by a buyer of hops which had been treated with sulphur since the buyer explicitly expressed the importance of this requirement. The relative knowledge of the parties may also be a factor, as in English case of ''Bissett v Wilkinson''<ref name=\\\"Bissett v Wilkinson\\\">''Bissett v Wilkinson'' [1927] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 177.</ref> where the court did not find misrepresentation when a seller said that farmland being sold would carry 2000 sheep if worked by one team; the buyer was considered sufficiently knowledgeable to accept or reject the seller's opinion.\\n\\n===Standard terms and contracts of adhesion===\\n[[Standard form contract]]s contain \\\"[[Boilerplate clause|boilerplate]]\\\", which is a set of \\\"[[one size fits all]]\\\" contract provisions. However, the term may also narrowly refer to conditions at the end of the contract which specify the governing law provision, venue, assignment and delegation, waiver of jury trial, notice, and [[force majeure]]. Restrictive provisions in contracts where the consumer has little negotiating power (\\\"contracts of adhesion\\\") attract [[consumer protection]] scrutiny.\\n\\n===Implied terms===\\nA term may either be express or implied.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/implied-terms-in-a-contract-definition-explanation.html|title=Implied Terms in a Contract: Definition & Explanation - Video & Lesson Transcript {{!}} Study.com|website=study.com|access-date=2018-09-14}}</ref> An express term is stated by the parties during negotiation or written in a contractual document. Implied terms are not stated but nevertheless form a provision of the contract.\\n\\n====Terms implied in fact====\\nTerms may be implied due to the factual circumstances or conduct of the parties. In the case of ''[[BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings]]'',<ref name=\\\"BP Refinery\\\"/> the UK [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]], on appeal from Australia, proposed a five-stage test to determine situations where the facts of a case may imply terms. The classic tests have been the \\\"business efficacy test\\\" and the \\\"officious bystander test\\\". Under the \\\"business efficacy test\\\" first proposed in ''[[The Moorcock]]'' [1889], the minimum terms necessary to give business efficacy to the contract will be implied. Under the officious bystander test (named in ''[[Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd v Shirlaw]]'' [1940] but actually originating in ''Reigate v. Union Manufacturing Co (Ramsbottom) Ltd'' [1918]), a term can only be implied in fact if an \\\"officious bystander\\\" listening to the contract negotiations suggested that the term be included the parties would promptly agree. The difference between these tests is questionable.\\n\\n====Terms implied in law====\\n[[Statute]]s or [[common law|judicial rulings]] may create implied contractual terms, particularly in standardized relationships such as employment or shipping contracts. The Uniform Commercial Code of the United States also imposes an [[implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing]] in performance and enforcement of contracts covered by the Code. In addition, [[Australia]], [[Israel]] and [[India]] imply a similar good faith term through laws.\\n\\nIn England, some contracts (insurance and partnerships) require [[Uberrima fides|utmost good faith]], while others may require [[Good faith (law)|good faith]] (employment contracts and agency). Most English contracts do '''not''' need any good faith, provided that the law is met. There is, however, an overarching concept of \\\"[[legitimate expectation]]\\\".\\n\\nMost [[Country|countries]] have statutes which deal directly with sale of goods, lease transactions, and trade practices. In the United States, prominent examples include, in the case of products, an implied [[warranty]] of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, and in the case of homes an implied warranty of habitability.\\n\\nIn the United Kingdom, implied terms may be created by:\\n* Statute, such as the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]], the [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]] and the [[Hague-Visby Rules]];\\n* Common Law, such as ''[[The Moorcock]]'',<ref>''[[The Moorcock]]'' (1889) 14 PD 64.</ref> which introduced the \\\"business efficacy\\\" test;\\n* Previous Dealings, as in [[J Spurling Ltd v Bradshaw|''Spurling v Bradshaw'']].<ref>{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[J Spurling Ltd v Bradshaw]] |year=1956 |court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=3 |parallelcite=[1956] 2 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 121 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\\n* Custom, as in ''[[Hutton v Warren]]''.<ref>''[[Hutton v Warren]]'' [1836] M&W 466.</ref>\\n\\n====Terms implied by custom====\\nA term may be implied on the basis of custom or usage in a particular market or context.

For example, under certain circumstances, false statements or promises made by a seller of goods regarding the quality or nature of the product that the seller has may constitute misrepresentation. A finding of misrepresentation allows for a remedy of rescission and sometimes damages depending on the type of misrepresentation.\\n\\nIn a court of law, to prove misrepresentation and/or fraud, there must be evidence that shows a claim was made, said claim was false, the party making the claim knew the claim was false, and that party's intention was for a transaction to occur based upon the false claim.<ref name=\\\":1\\\">{{Cite book|last=Knapp|first=Charles|title=Problems in Contract Law: Cases and Materials|last2=Crystal|first2=Nathan|last3=Prince|first3=Harry|publisher=Aspen Publishers/Wolters Kluwer Law & Business|year=2007|isbn=|edition=4th|location=|pages=659}}</ref>\\n\\nThere are two types of misrepresentation: fraud in the factum and fraud in inducement. Fraud in the factum focuses on whether the party alleging misrepresentation knew they were creating a contract. If the party did not know that they were entering into a contract, there is no meeting of the minds, and the contract is void. Fraud in inducement focuses on misrepresentation attempting to get the party to enter into the contract. Misrepresentation of a material fact (if the party knew the truth, that party would not have entered into the contract) makes a contract voidable.\\n\\nAssume two people, Party A and Party B, enter into a contract.

Therefore, the question is what types of false claims (or deceptions) will be significant enough to void a contract based on said deception.

Common law has identified three types of mistake in contract: common mistake, mutual mistake, and unilateral mistake.\\n*'''Common mistake''' occurs when both parties hold the same mistaken belief of the facts. This is demonstrated in the case of ''[[Bell v. Lever Brothers Ltd.]]'',<ref>''[[Bell v. Lever Brothers Ltd.]]'' [1931] ALL E.R. Rep. 1, [1932] A.C. 161</ref> which established that common mistake can only void a contract if the mistake of the subject-matter was sufficiently fundamental to render its identity different from what was contracted, making the performance of the contract impossible.<ref name=\\\"Svanosi v McNamara\\\">see also {{cite AustLII|HCA|55|1956|litigants=Svanosi v McNamara |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.</ref> In ''Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd'', the court held that the common law will grant relief against common mistake, if the test in ''Bell v. Lever Bros Ltd'' is made out.<ref>{{cite BAILII|court=EWCA |division=Civ |year=2002 |num=1407 |litigants=Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd] |courtname=auto}}.</ref> If one party has knowledge and the other does not, and the party with the knowledge promises or guarantees the existence of the subject matter, that party will be in breach if the subject matter does not exist.<ref name=\\\"McRae v Commonwealth\\\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|79|1951|litigants=[[McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1951/79.pdf (1951) 84 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 377] |courtname=auto |date=}}.</ref>\\n*'''Mutual mistake''' occurs when both parties of a contract are mistaken as to the terms. Each believes they are contracting to something different. Courts usually try to uphold such mistakes if a reasonable interpretation of the terms can be found. However, a contract based on a mutual mistake in judgment does not cause the contract to be voidable by the party that is adversely affected. See ''[[Raffles v Wichelhaus]]''.<ref>''[[Raffles v Wichelhaus]]'' (1864) 2 Hurl. & C. 906.</ref>\\n*'''Unilateral mistake''' occurs when only one party to a contract is mistaken as to the terms or subject-matter. The courts will uphold such a contract unless it was determined that the non-mistaken party was aware of the mistake and tried to take advantage of the mistake.<ref>[[Smith v. Hughes]] [1871].</ref><ref name=\\\"Taylor v Johnson\\\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|5|1983|litigants=[[Taylor v Johnson]] |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.</ref> It is also possible for a contract to be void if there was a mistake in the identity of the contracting party. An example is in ''Lewis v Avery''<ref>{{cite BAILII|court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=4 |year=1971 |litigants=Lewis v Avery |parallelcite=[1971] 3 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 907 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> where [[Lord Denning|Lord Denning MR]] held that the contract can only be voided if the plaintiff can show that, at the time of agreement, the plaintiff believed the other party's identity was of vital importance. A mere mistaken belief as to the credibility of the other party is not sufficient.\\n\\n===Duress and undue influence===\\n{{Main|Duress (contract law)|Undue influence}}\\nDuress has been defined as a \\\"threat of harm made to compel a person to do something against his or her will or judgment; esp., a wrongful threat made by one person to compel a manifestation of seeming assent by another person to a transaction without real volition.\\\"<ref>[[Black's Law Dictionary]] (8th ed. 2004)</ref> An example is in ''[[Barton v Armstrong]]'' [1976] in a person was threatened with death if they did not sign the contract. An innocent party wishing to set aside a contract for duress to the person need only to prove that the threat was made and that it was a reason for entry into the contract; the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] then shifts to the other party to prove that the threat had no effect in causing the party to enter into the contract. There can also be duress to goods and sometimes, 'economic duress'.\\n\\nUndue influence is an equitable doctrine that involves one person taking advantage of a position of power over another person through a special relationship such as between parent and child or solicitor and client. As an equitable doctrine, the court has discretion. When no special relationship exists, the question is whether there was a relationship of such trust and confidence that it should give rise to such a presumption.<ref>{{cite AustLII|HCA|41|1936|litigants=[[Johnson v Buttress]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1936/41.pdf (1936) 56 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 113] |courtname=auto |date=17 August 1936}}.</ref><ref>See also {{cite AustLII|VicRp|29|1982|litigants=Westmelton (Vic) Pty Ltd v Archer and Shulman |parallecite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.</ref><ref>''Odorizzi v.

However, the agreement was unenforceable as it was intended to \\\"stifle a criminal prosecution\\\", and the bank was forced to return the payments made by the husband.\\n\\nIn the U.S., one unusual type of unenforceable contract is a personal [[employment]] contract to work as a spy or secret agent. This is because the very secrecy of the contract is a condition of the contract (in order to maintain [[plausible deniability]]). If the spy subsequently sues the government on the contract over issues like salary or benefits, then the spy has breached the contract by revealing its existence. It is thus unenforceable on that ground, as well as the public policy of maintaining [[national security]] (since a disgruntled agent might try to reveal ''all'' the government's secrets during his/her lawsuit).<ref>''[[Tenet v. Doe]]'', {{ussc|544|1|2005}}.</ref>  Other types of unenforceable employment contracts include contracts agreeing to work for less than [[minimum wage]] and forfeiting the right to [[workman's compensation]] in cases where workman's compensation is due.\\n\\n===Remedies for defendant on defenses===\\n\\n====Setting aside the contract====\\nThere can be four different ways in which contracts can be set aside. A contract may be deemed '[[void (law)|void]]', '[[voidable]]', '[[unenforceable]]' or 'ineffective'. Voidness implies that a contract never came into existence. Voidability implies that one or both parties may declare a contract ineffective at their wish. Kill fees are paid by magazine publishers to authors when their articles are submitted on time but are subsequently not used for publication. When this occurs, the magazine cannot claim copyright for the \\\"killed\\\" assignment. Unenforceability implies that neither party may have recourse to a court for a remedy. Ineffectiveness implies that the contract terminates by order of a court where a public body has failed to satisfy [[public procurement]] law. To [[Rescission (contract law)|rescind]] is to set aside or unmake a contract.\\n\\n==Disputes==\\n===Procedure===\\n{{Main|Civil procedure}}\\nIn many countries, in order to obtain damages for breach of contract or to obtain specific performance or other equitable relief, the aggrieved injured party may file a civil (non-criminal) lawsuit in court.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Farnsworth|first1=E. Allen|title=Legal Remedies for Breach of Contract|journal=Columbia Law Review|date=November 1970|volume=70|issue=7|pages=1145\\u20131216|jstor=1121184|doi=10.2307/1121184}}</ref>\\n\\nIn [[England and Wales]], a contract may be enforced by use of a [[claim (legal)|claim]], or in urgent cases by applying for an [[interim injunction]] to prevent a breach. Likewise, in the United States, an aggrieved party may apply for injunctive relief to prevent a threatened breach of contract, where such breach would result in irreparable harm that could not be adequately remedied by money damages.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rowan|first1=Sol\\u00e8ne|title=Remedies for Breach of Contract: A Comparative Analysis of the Protection of Performance|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199606603|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TofAQAAQBAJ|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref>\\n\\n====Arbitration====\\nIf the contract contains a valid [[arbitration]] clause then, prior to filing a lawsuit, the aggrieved party must submit an arbitration claim in accordance with the procedures set forth in the clause. Many contracts provide that all disputes arising thereunder will be resolved by arbitration, rather than litigated in courts.\\n\\nArbitration judgments may generally be enforced in the same manner as ordinary court judgments, and are recognized and enforceable internationally under the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention]], which has 156 parties. However, in New York Convention states, arbitral decisions are generally immune unless there is a showing that the arbitrator's decision was irrational or tainted by [[fraud]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=A.A.|title=Circumventing the Supremacy Clause - Understanding the Constitutional Implications of the United States' Treatment of Treaty Obligations through an Analysis of the New York Convention|journal=San Diego International Law Journal|date=2005|volume=7|page=491|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/sdintl7&div=24&id=&page=|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref>\\n\\nSome arbitration clauses are not enforceable, and in other cases arbitration may not be sufficient to resolve a legal dispute. For example, disputes regarding validity of registered IP rights may need to be resolved by a public body within the national registration system.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Arbitration in Intellectual Property?|url=http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/arbitration/why-is-arb.html|website=WIPO|publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref> For matters of significant public interest that go beyond the narrow interests of the parties to the agreement, such as  claims that a party violated a contract by engaging in illegal anti-competitive conduct or committed civil rights violations, a court might find that the parties may litigate some or all of their claims even before completing a contractually agreed arbitration process.<ref>See, e.g., {{cite journal|last1=Edwards|first1=Harry T.|title=Judicial Review of Labor Arbitration Awards: The Clash Between the Public Policy Exception and the Duty to Bargain|journal=Chicago-Kent Law Review|date=1988|volume=64|issue=1|page=4|url=http://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2709&context=cklawreview|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref>\\n\\n=====United States=====\\nIn the United States, thirty-five states (notably not including New York)<ref>New York Civil Procedure Law and Rules \\u00a7 7501, et seq.</ref> and the District of Columbia have adopted the [[Uniform Arbitration Act]] to facilitate the enforcement of arbitrated judgments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Uniform Arbitration Act (1956 Act or 2000 Act)|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uniform/vol7#arbit|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref>\\n\\nCustomer claims against securities brokers and dealers are almost always resolved pursuant to contractual arbitration clauses because securities dealers are required under the terms of their membership in self-regulatory organizations such as the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (formerly the NASD) or [[NYSE]] to arbitrate disputes with their customers.

In the absence of a [[choice of law clause]], the court will normally apply either the law of the forum or the law of the jurisdiction that has the strongest connection to the subject matter of the contract. A choice of law clause allows the parties to agree in advance that their contract will be interpreted under the laws of a specific jurisdiction.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Common Contract Clauses|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/contract_clauses.html#choice-of-law-and-forum-clause|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=10 October 2017|date=22 July 2016}}</ref>\\n\\nWithin the United States, choice of law clauses are generally enforceable, although exceptions based upon public policy may at times apply.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Healy|first1=James J.|title=Consumer Protection Choice of Law: European Lessons for the United States|journal=Duke Journal of Comparative & International Law|date=2008|volume=19|page=535|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1284&context=djcil|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref> Within the European Union, even when the parties have negotiated a choice of law clause, conflict of law issues may be governed by the [[Rome I Regulation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32008R0593|website=Eur-Lex|accessdate=10 October 2017|date=17 June 2008}}</ref>\\n\\n====Choice of forum====\\nMany contracts contain a [[forum selection clause]] setting out where disputes in relation to the contract should be litigated. The clause may be general, requiring that any case arising from the contract be filed within a specific state or country, or it may require that a case be filed in a specific court. For example, a choice of forum clause may require that a case be filed in the U.S. State of California, or it may require more specifically that the case be filed in the Superior Court for Los Angeles County.\\n\\nA choice of law or venue is not necessarily binding upon a court. Based upon an analysis of the laws, rules of procedure and public policy of the state and court in which the case was filed, a court that is identified by the clause may find that it should not exercise jurisdiction, or a court in a different jurisdiction or venue may find that the litigation may proceed despite the clause.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://guides.lib.monash.edu/commercial-law/contract-law|title=Commercial law: Contract law|last=|first=|date=|website=Monash University|access-date=}}</ref> As part of that analysis, a court may examine whether the clause conforms with the formal requirements of the jurisdiction in which the case was filed (in some jurisdictions a choice of forum or choice of venue clause only limits the parties if the word \\\"exclusive\\\" is explicitly included in the clause). Some jurisdictions will not accept an action that has no connection to the court that was chosen, and others will not enforce a choice of venue clause when they consider themselves to be a more [[forum non conveniens|convenient forum]] for the litigation.<ref>See, e.g., {{cite journal|last1=Mullenix|first1=Linda A.|title=Another Choice of Forum, Another Choice of Law: Consensual Adjudicatory Procedure in Federal Court|journal=Fordham Law Review|date=1988|volume=57|page=291|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/flr57&div=20&id=&page=|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref>\\n\\nSome contracts are governed by multilateral instruments that require a non-chosen court to dismiss cases and require the recognition of judgments made by courts having jurisdiction based on a choice of court clause. For example, the [[Brussels regime]] instruments (31 European states) and the [[Hague Choice of Court Agreements Convention]] (European Union, Mexico, Montenegro, Singapore), as well as several instruments related to a specific area of law, may require courts to enforce and recognize choice of law clauses and foreign judgments.\\n\\n===Remedies===\\n{{Main|Breach of contract}}\\nIn the United Kingdom, breach of contract is defined in the [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]] as:  [i] non-performance, [ ii] poor performance, [iii] part-performance, or [iv] performance which is substantially different from what was reasonably expected.  Innocent parties may repudiate (cancel) the contract only for a major breach (breach of condition),<ref>[[Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd]] [1962] 1 All ER 474; see also {{cite AustLII|HCA|24|1951|litigants=Associated Newspapers Ltd v Bancks |parallelcite=(1951) 83 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 322 |courtname=auto}}.</ref><ref>The Mihailis Angelos [1971] 1 QB 164</ref> but they may always recover compensatory damages, provided that the breach has caused foreseeable loss.\\n\\nIt was not possible to sue [[the Crown]] in the UK for breach of contract before 1948. However, it was appreciated that contractors might be reluctant to deal on such a basis and claims were entertained under a [[petition of right]] that needed to be endorsed by the [[Home Secretary]] and [[Attorney-General]]. S.1 [[Crown Proceedings Act 1947]] opened the Crown to ordinary contractual claims through the courts as for any other person.\\n\\n====Damages====\\n{{Main|Damages}}\\nThere are several different types of damages.\\n*Compensatory damages, which are given to the party injured by the breach of contract. With compensatory damages, there are two [[heads of loss]], consequential damage and direct damage. In theory, compensatory damages are designed to put the injured party in his or her rightful position, usually through an award of expectation damages.\\n*Liquidated damages are an estimate of loss agreed to in the contract, so that the court avoids calculating compensatory damages and the parties have greater certainty. Liquidated damages clauses may be called \\\"penalty clauses\\\" in ordinary language, but the law distinguishes between liquidated damages (legitimate) and penalties (invalid). A test for determining which category a clause falls into was established by the English House of Lords in ''[[Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage & Motor Co Ltd]]''<ref>{{cite BAILII |year=1914 |court=UKHL |num=1 |litigants=[[Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage & Motor Co Ltd]] |parallelcite=[1915] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 79 at 86 per Lord Dunedin |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\\n*Nominal damages consist of a small cash amount where the court concludes that the defendant is in breach but the plaintiff has suffered no quantifiable pecuniary loss, and may be sought to obtain a legal record of who was at fault.\\n*Punitive or exemplary damages are used to punish the party at fault; but even though such damages are not intended primarily to compensate, nevertheless the claimant (and not the state) receives the award.  Exemplary damages are not recognised nor permitted in some jurisdictions.  In the UK, exemplary damages are not available for breach of contract, but are possible after fraud.  Although vitiating factors (such as misrepresentation, mistake, undue influence and duress) relate to contracts, they are not contractual actions, and so, in a roundabout way, a claimant in contract may be able to get exemplary damages.\\n\\nCompensatory damages compensate the plaintiff for actual losses suffered as accurately as possible.  They may be \\\"expectation damages\\\", \\\"reliance damages\\\" or \\\"[[restitution]]ary damages\\\".  Expectation damages are awarded to put the party in as good of a position as the party would have been in had the contract been performed as promised.<ref>{{cite AustLII|HCA|36|1954|litigants=Bellgrove v Eldridge |parallelcite=(1954) 90 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 613 |date=20 August 1954 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>  Reliance damages are usually awarded where no reasonably reliable estimate of expectation loss can be arrived at or at the option of the plaintiff. Reliance losses cover expense suffered in reliance to the promise. Examples where reliance damages have been awarded because profits are too speculative include the Australian case of ''[[McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission]]''<ref name=\\\"McRae v Commonwealth\\\"/> which concerned a contract for the rights to salvage a ship. In ''Anglia Television Ltd v. Reed''<ref>[1972] 1 QB 60</ref> the English Court of Appeal awarded the plaintiff expenditures incurred prior to the contract in preparation of performance.\\n\\nAfter a breach has occurred, the innocent party has a duty to mitigate loss by taking any reasonable steps.  Failure to mitigate means that damages may be reduced or even denied altogether.<ref>The [[Uniform Commercial Code|UCC]] states, \\\"Consequential damages... include any loss... which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise.\\\" UCC 2-715.In English law the chief authority on mitigation is ''British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co v Underground Electric Railway Co of London''[1912] AC 673, see especially 689 per Lord Haldane.</ref> However, Professor Michael Furmston <ref>M.P. Furmston, ''Cheshire, Fifoot & Furmston's Law of Contract'', 15th edn (OUP: Oxford, 2007) p.779.</ref> has argued that \\\"it is wrong to express (the mitigation) rule by stating that the plaintiff is under a duty to mitigate his loss\\\",<ref>M.P. Furmston, ''Cheshire, Fifoot & Furmston's Law of Contract'', 15th edn (OUP: Oxford, 2007) p.779 n.130.</ref> citing ''Sotiros Shipping Inc v Sameiet, The Solholt''.<ref>''Sotiros Shipping Inc v Sameiet, The Solholt'' [1983] 1 Lloyd's Rep 605.</ref> If a party provides notice that the contract will not be completed, an [[anticipatory breach]] occurs.\\n\\nDamages may be general or consequential. General damages are those damages which naturally flow from a breach of contract. Consequential damages are those damages which, although not naturally flowing from a breach, are naturally supposed by both parties at the time of contract formation. An example would be when someone rents a car to get to a business meeting, but when that person arrives to pick up the car, it is not there. General damages would be the cost of renting a different car. Consequential damages would be the lost business if that person was unable to get to the meeting, if both parties knew the reason the party was renting the car. However, there is still a duty to mitigate the losses. The fact that the car was not there does not give the party a right to not attempt to rent another car.\\n\\nTo recover damages, a claimant must show that the breach of contract caused foreseeable loss.<ref name=\\\"Hadley v Baxendale\\\"/><ref>See also ''Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corp Ltd'' (1987) 9 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 310.</ref> ''[[Hadley v Baxendale]]'' established that the test of foreseeability is both objective or subjective.  In other words, is it foreseeable to the objective bystander, or to the contracting parties, who may have special knowledge?  On the facts of this case, where a miller lost production because a carrier delayed taking broken mill parts for repair, the court held that no damages were payable since the loss was foreseeable neither by the \\\"reasonable man\\\" nor by the carrier, both of whom would have expected the miller to have a spare part in store.\\n\\n====Specific performance====\\n{{Main|Specific performance}}\\nThere may be circumstances in which it would be unjust to permit the defaulting party simply to buy out the injured party with damages. For example, where an art collector purchases a rare painting and the vendor refuses to deliver, the collector's damages would be equal to the sum paid.\\n\\nThe court may make an order of what is called \\\"specific performance\\\", requiring that the contract be performed. In some circumstances a court will order a party to perform his or her promise (an order of \\\"[[specific performance]]\\\") or issue an order, known as an \\\"injunction\\\", that a party refrain from doing something that would breach the contract. A specific performance is obtainable for the breach of a contract to sell land or real estate on such grounds that the property has a unique value. In the [[United States]] by way of the [[13th Amendment to the United States Constitution]], specific performance in personal service contracts is only legal \\\"''as punishment for a crime whereof the criminal shall be dully convicted''.\\\"<ref>{{cite web | title = 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution | url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.amendmentxiii.html | accessdate = 2008-10-10}}</ref>\\n\\nBoth an order for specific performance and an injunction are discretionary remedies, originating for the most part in [[Equity (law)|equity]]. Neither is available as of right and in most jurisdictions and most circumstances a court will not normally order specific performance. A contract for the sale of real property is a notable exception. In most jurisdictions, the sale of real property is enforceable by specific performance. Even in this case the defenses to an action in equity (such as [[Laches (equity)|laches]], the ''bona fide'' purchaser rule, or [[unclean hands]]) may act as a bar to specific performance.\\n\\nRelated to orders for specific performance, an injunction may be requested when the contract prohibits a certain action. Action for injunction would prohibit the person from performing the act specified in the contract.\\n\\n==History==\\n{{main|History of contract law|Roman law}}\\n\\nWhilst early rules of trade and barter have existed since ancient times, modern laws of contract in the West are traceable from the industrial revolution (1750 onwards), when increasing numbers worked in factories for a cash wage.  In particular, the growing strength of the British economy and the adaptability and flexibility of the [[English law|English common law]] led to a swift development of English<ref>as opposed to Scottish law</ref> contract law, while the more rigid civil law in Europe lagged behind.<ref>In 1789, while the French were engaged in their revolution, the English law was busying itself in defining the rules of auctions: see [[Payne v Cave]]</ref> Colonies within the British empire (including the [[United States|USA]] and [[Dominion|the Dominions]]) would [[Reception statute|adopt the law]] of the mother country.  Civil law countries (especially Germany) later developed their own brand of contract law.  In the 20th century, the growth of export trade led to countries adopting international conventions, such as the [[Hague-Visby Rules]] and the [[United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods|UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods]],<ref>Willmott, L, Christensen, S, Butler, D, & Dixon, B 2009 ''Contract Law'', Third Edition, Oxford University Press, North Melbourne</ref> to promote uniform regulations.\\n\\n[[File:Bill of sale Louvre AO3765.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Bill of sale]] of a male slave and a building in Shuruppak, [[Sumer]]ian tablet, circa 2600 BC]]\\nContract law is based on the principle expressed in the [[Latin]] phrase ''[[pacta sunt servanda]],'' ( \\\"agreements must be kept\\\").<ref>[[Hans Wehberg]], ''[[Pacta Sunt Servanda]],'' [[The American Journal of International Law]], Vol. 53, No. 4 (Oct., 1959), [http://www.trans-lex.org/129500 p.775.]; Trans-Lex.org [http://www.trans-lex.org/919000 Principle of Sanctity of contracts]</ref> The common law of contract originated with the now-defuct writ of [[assumpsit]], which was originally a [[tort]] action based on reliance.<ref>Atiyah PS. (1986) [http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3852&context=lcp Medical Malpractice and Contract/Tort Boundary]. ''Law and Contemporary Problems''.</ref> Contract law falls within the general [[law of obligations]], along with [[tort]], [[unjust enrichment]], and [[restitution]].<ref>However, a movement in the 1990s to replace the separate teaching of contract and tort with a unified law of \\\"obligations\\\" has met with little success.</ref>\\n\\nJurisdictions vary in their principles of [[freedom of contract]]. In common law jurisdictions such as  England and the United States, a high degree of freedom is the norm. For example, in [[Law of the United States|American law]], it was determined in the 1901 case of ''[[Hurley v. Eddingfield]]'' that a physician was permitted to deny treatment to a patient despite the lack of other available medical assistance and the patient's subsequent death.<ref>Blake V. (2012). [http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2012/05/hlaw1-1205.html When Is a Patient-Physician Relationship Established?]. ''Virtual Mentor''.</ref> This is in contrast to the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], which typically applies certain overarching principles to disputes arising out of contract, as in the [[French Civil Code]]. Other legal systems such as Islamic law, socialist legal systems, and customary law have their own variations.\\n\\nHowever, in both the [[European union]] and the United States, the need to prevent discrimination has eroded the full extent of freedom of contract. Legislation governing equality, equal pay, racial discrimination, disability discrimination and so on, has imposed limits of the full freedom of contract.<ref name=Bernstein/> For example, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] restricted private racial discrimination against African-Americans.<ref>Douglas D. (2002). [http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&context=facpubs Contract Rights and Civil Rights]. ''Michigan Law Review''.</ref> In the early 20th century, the United States underwent the \\\"[[Lochner era]]\\\", in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] struck down economic regulations on the basis of freedom of contract and the [[Due Process Clause]]; these decisions were eventually overturned, and the Supreme Court established a deference to legislative statutes and regulations that restrict freedom of contract.<ref name=Bernstein>Bernstein DE. (2008). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1239749 Freedom of Contract]. George Mason Law & Economics Research Paper No. 08-51.</ref> The US Constitution contains a [[Contract Clause]], but this has been interpreted as only restricting the retroactive impairment of contracts.<ref name=Bernstein/>\\n\\n==Commercial use==\\nContracts are widely used in [[commercial law]], and form the legal foundation for transactions across the world. Common examples include [[contract of sale|contracts for the sale]] of [[professional service|services]] and goods (both wholesale and retail), [[construction law|construction contracts]], [[Contract of carriage|contracts of carriage]], [[software license]]s, [[employment contract]]s, [[insurance policy|insurance policies]], sale or lease of land, and various other uses.\\n\\nAlthough the [[European Union]] is fundamentally an economic community with a range of trade rules, there is no overarching \\\"EU Law of Contract\\\". In 1993, [[Harvey McGregor]], a British barrister and academic, produced a \\\"Contract Code\\\" under the auspices of the English and Scottish [[Law Commission]]s, which was a proposal to both unify and codify the contract laws of England and Scotland. This document was offered as a possible \\\"Contract Code for Europe\\\", but tensions between English and German jurists meant that this proposal has so far come to naught.<ref>... indeed the Code was neither published nor adopted by the UK, instead being privately published by an Italian University</ref>\\n\\n==Contract theory==\\nContract theory is the body of legal theory that addresses normative and conceptual questions in contract law. One of the most important questions asked in contract theory is why contracts are enforced. One prominent answer to this question focuses on the economic benefits of enforcing bargains. Another approach, associated with [[Charles Fried]], maintains that the purpose of contract law is to enforce promises. This theory is developed in Fried's book, ''Contract as Promise.'' Other approaches to contract theory are found in the writings of [[legal realism|legal realists]] and [[critical legal studies]] theorists.\\n\\nMore generally, writers have propounded [[Marxist]] and feminist interpretations of contract.  Attempts at overarching understandings of the purpose and nature of contract as a phenomenon have been made, notably [[Relational contract|relational contract theory]] originally developed by U.S. contracts scholars [[Ian Roderick Macneil]] and Stewart Macaulay, building at least in part on the contract theory work of U.S. scholar [[Lon L. Fuller]], while U.S. scholars have been at the forefront of developing economic theories of contract focussing on questions of [[transaction cost]] and so-called '[[efficient breach]]' theory.\\n\\nAnother dimension of the theoretical debate in contract is its place within, and relationship to a wider [[law of obligations]]. Obligations have traditionally been divided into contracts, which are voluntarily undertaken and owed to a specific person or persons, and obligations in [[tort]] which are based on the wrongful infliction of harm to certain protected interests, primarily imposed by the law, and typically owed to a wider class of persons.\\n\\nRecently it has been accepted that there is a third category, restitutionary obligations, based on the [[unjust enrichment]] of the defendant at the plaintiff's expense. Contractual liability, reflecting the constitutive function of contract, is generally for failing to make things better (by not rendering the expected performance), liability in tort is generally for action (as opposed to omission) making things worse, and liability in restitution is for unjustly taking or retaining the benefit of the plaintiff's money or work.<ref>Beatson, ''Anson's Law of Contract'' (1998) 27th ed. OUP, p.21</ref>\\n\\nThe common law describes the circumstances under which the law will recognise the existence of rights, privilege or power arising out of a promise.\\n\\n==Gallery==\\n<gallery>\\nFile:Chinese Slave trade.jpg|A contract from the [[Tang dynasty]] that records the purchase of a 15-year-old slave for six bolts of plain silk and five Chinese coins\\nFile:Heiratsbrief Gottfried Werner von Zimmern Apollonia von Henneberg 1521 img02.jpg|German marriage contract, 1521 between {{Interlanguage link multi|Gottfried Werner von Zimmern|de}} and Apollonia von Henneberg-R\\u00f6mhild\\nFile:Insurance Contact 2.jpg|[[Thomas Boylston]] to [[Thomas Jefferson]], May 1786, Maritime Insurance Premiums\\nFile:Insurance contract.jpg|[[Fire insurance]] contract of 1796\\n</gallery>\\n\\n==See also==<!-- Please respect alphabetical order -->\\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\\n*[[Arbitration clause]]\\n*[[Bill of sale]]\\n*[[Conflict of contract laws]]\\n*[[Contract awarding]]\\n*[[Contract farming]]\\n*[[Contract management]]\\n*[[Contract of sale]]\\n*[[Contract theory]] (economics)\\n*[[Wikt:contracting|Contracting]]\\n*[[:Category:Contract clauses|Contractual clauses]] (category)\\n*[[Design by contract]]\\n*[[Document automation]]\\n*[[Electronic signature]]\\n*[[Estoppel]]\\n*[[Ethical implications in contracts]]\\n*[[Force majeure]]\\n*[[Further assurances]]\\n*[[Gentlemen's agreement]]\\n*[[Good faith]]\\n*[[Implicit contract theory|Implicit contract]]\\n*[[Indenture]]\\n*[[Information asymmetry]]\\n*[[Invitation to treat]]\\n*[[Legal remedy]]\\n*[[Letters of assist]]\\n*[[Meet-or-release contract]]\\n*[[Memorandum of understanding]]\\n*[[Negotiation]]\\n*[[Option contract]]\\n*[[Order (business)]]\\n*[[Peppercorn (legal)]]\\n*[[Perfect tender rule]]\\n*[[Principal\\u2013agent problem]]\\n*[[Quasi-contract]]\\n*[[Restitution]]\\n*[[Smart contract]]\\n*[[Social contract]]\\n*[[Specification (technical standard)]]\\n*[[Standard form contract]]\\n*[[Stipulation]]\\n*[[Tortious interference]]\\n*[[Unjust enrichment]]\\n*[[Voidable contract]]\\n{{div col end}}\\n\\n===By country===\\n{{div col|colwidth=50em}}\\n*[[Australian contract law]]\\n*[[Sharia]]\\n*[[Law of obligations (Bulgaria)]]\\n*[[English contract law]]\\n*[[German contract law]]\\n*[[Indian contract law]]\\n*[[South African contract law]]\\n*[[United States contract law]]\\n{{div col end}}\\n\\n==Notes==\\n{{Reflist|2}}\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Library resources box}}\\n*Ewan McKendrick, ''Contract Law - Text, Cases and Materials'' (2005) Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0-19-927480-0}}\\n*P.S.

It has been partly responsible for a huge increase in the number of poker players worldwide. Christiansen Capital Advisors stated online poker revenues grew from $82.7 million in 2001 to $2.4 billion in 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/56438 |title=Going All In For Online Poker |publisher=Newsweek |date=2005-08-15 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref> while a survey carried out by DrKW and Global Betting and Gaming Consultants asserted online poker revenues in 2004 were at $1.4 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto062720050064003754 |title=Financial Times: Online Poker 2004 revenues and 2008 forecast |publisher=Us.ft.com |date=2003-08-28 |accessdate=2009-03-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520074854/http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto062720050064003754 |archivedate=2009-05-20 }}</ref> In a testimony before the [[United States Senate]] regarding Internet Gaming, Grant Eve, a Certified Public Accountant representing the US Accounting Firm [[Joseph Eve, Certified Public Accountants]], estimated that one in every four dollars gambled is gambled online.<ref name=Joseph>{{cite web|last=Eve|first=Grant|title=Grant Eve Testimony 111711 - United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs|url=http://www.indian.senate.gov/hearings/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&pageid=9698|work=The Future of Internet Gaming|accessdate=11 January 2013}}</ref>\\n\\n==Overview==\\nTraditional (or \\\"[[brick and mortar]]\\\", B&M, live, land-based) venues for playing poker, such as [[casino]]s and poker rooms, may be intimidating for novice players and are often located in geographically disparate locations. Also, brick and mortar casinos are reluctant to promote poker because it is difficult for them to profit from it. Though the [[Rake (poker)|rake]], or time charge, of traditional casinos is often high, the [[opportunity cost]]s of running a poker room are even higher. Brick and mortar casinos often make much more money by removing poker rooms and adding more [[slot machine]]s. For example, figures from the Gaming Accounting Firm [[Joseph Eve, Certified Public Accountants|Joseph Eve]] estimate that poker accounts for 1% of brick and mortar casino revenues.<ref name=Joseph /> [[File:PokerTableOpenSource.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Screenshot of [[open-source]] [[PokerTH]] table]]\\n\\nOnline venues, by contrast, are dramatically cheaper because they have much smaller overhead costs. For example, adding another table does not take up valuable space like it would for a brick and mortar casino. Online poker rooms also allow the players to play for low stakes (as low as 1\\u00a2/2\\u00a2) and often offer poker [[Freeroll (poker)|freeroll]] tournaments (where there is no entry fee), attracting beginners and/or less wealthy clientele.\\n\\nOnline venues may be more vulnerable to certain types of [[fraud]], especially [[collusion]] between players. However, they have collusion detection abilities that do not exist in brick and mortar casinos. For example, online poker room security employees can look at the [[hand history]] of the cards previously played by any player on the site, making patterns of behavior easier to detect than in a casino where colluding players can simply fold their hands without anyone ever knowing the strength of their holding. Online poker rooms also check players' [[IP address]]es in order to prevent players at the same household or at known [[open proxy]] servers from playing on the same tables. Digital [[device fingerprinting]] also allows poker sites to recognize and block players who create new accounts in attempts to circumvent prior account bans, restrictions and closures.\\n\\n== History ==\\nFree poker online was played as early as the late 1990s in the form of [[IRC poker]]. [[Planet Poker]] was the first online card room to offer real money games in 1998. The first real money poker game was dealt on January 1, 1998. Author [[Mike Caro]] became the \\\"face\\\" of Planet Poker in October 1999.\\n\\nThe major online poker sites offer varying features to entice new players. One common feature is to offer tournaments called satellites by which the winners gain entry to real-life poker tournaments. It was through one such tournament on [[PokerStars]] that [[Chris Moneymaker]] won his entry to the [[2003 World Series of Poker]]. He went on to win the main event, causing shock in the poker world, and beginning the [[poker boom]]. The 2004 World Series featured three times as many players as in 2003. At least four players in the WSOP final table won their entry through an online cardroom. Like Moneymaker, 2004 winner [[Greg Raymer]] also won his entry at the [[PokerStars]] online cardroom.\\n\\nIn October 2004, [[Sportingbet]], at the time the world's largest publicly traded online gaming company (SBT.L), announced the acquisition of [[Sportingbet|ParadisePoker.com]], one of the online poker industry's first and largest cardrooms. The $340 million acquisition marked the first time an online card room was owned by a public company. Since then, several other card room parent companies have gone public.\\n\\nIn June 2005, [[PartyGaming]], the parent company of the then-largest online cardroom, PartyPoker, went public on the [[London Stock Exchange]], achieving an [[initial public offering]] market value in excess of $8 billion. At the time of the IPO, ninety-two percent of Party Gaming's income came from poker operations.\\n\\nIn early 2006, PartyGaming moved to acquire EmpirePoker.com from [[Empire Online]]. Later in the year, [[bwin]], an Austrian-based online gambling company, acquired PokerRoom.com. Other poker rooms such as [[PokerStars]] that were rumored to be exploring initial public offerings have postponed them.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2095-2136074,00.html Pokerstars reveals hand with plans for \\u00a31bn float] [[The Times]]</ref>\\n\\nAs of March 2008, there are fewer than forty stand-alone cardrooms and poker networks with detectable levels of traffic.

On the other hand, PokerStars paid $1 billion in fines immediately.\\n\\nIn 2014, PokerStars became the largest publicly traded company in the industry of poker when businessman David Baazov initiated a takeover bid costing $4.9 billion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrenheitner/2014/06/19/how-a-4-9-billion-purchase-of-pokerstars-could-change-online-poker-in-america/|title=How A $4.9 Billion Purchase Of PokerStars Could Change Online Poker In America|last=Heitner|first=Darren|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-06-11}}</ref>\\n\\nThe [[2019\\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] has resulted in a massive increase in online poker traffic. The pandemic is believed to have directed both professional and recreational players who normally prefer live poker to online platforms due the indefinite closure of most casinos and other live gaming venues worldwide, with even many [[Underground poker|unlicensed venues]] shutting down. In addition, the sudden dearth of live entertainment options due to the widespread disruption of the sports and entertainment schedules around the world is believed to have resulted in more than the usual number of casual players turning to online poker as an alternative. Many operators reported traffic of double or more the previous volume, depending on the time of day.\\n\\n==Legality==\\nFrom a legal perspective, online poker may differ in some ways from online casino gambling. However, many of the same issues do apply. For a discussion of the legality of online gambling in general, see [[online gambling]].\\n\\nOnline poker is legal and regulated in many countries including several nations in and around the [[Caribbean Sea]], and most notably the [[United Kingdom]].\\n\\n===United States===\\nIn the United States, the [[North Dakota]] House of Representatives passed a bill in February 2005 to legalize and regulate online poker and online poker card room operators in the state. The legislation required that online poker operations would have to physically locate their entire operations in the state. Testifying before the state Senate Judiciary committee, Nigel Payne, CEO of Sportingbet and owner of Paradise Poker, pledged to relocate to the state if the bill became law.<ref>{{cite web |first=Tom |last=Rafferty |url=http://www.bismarcktribune.com/articles/2005/03/09/news/topnews/top01.txt |title=Bismarck Tribune |publisher=Bismarck Tribune |date=2005-03-08 |accessdate=2009-03-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060408122500/http://www.bismarcktribune.com/articles/2005/03/09/news/topnews/top01.txt |archivedate=2006-04-08 }}</ref>\\n\\nThe measure, however, was defeated by the State Senate in March 2005 after the U.S. Department of Justice sent a letter to North Dakota attorney general [[Wayne Stenehjem]] stating that online gaming \\\"may\\\" be illegal, and that the pending legislation \\\"might\\\" violate the federal [[Federal Wire Act|Wire Act]]. However, many legal experts [[Online gambling#General legal issues|dispute the DOJ's claim]].\\n\\nIn response to this and other claims by the DOJ regarding the legality of online poker, many of the major online poker sites stopped advertising their \\\"dot-com\\\" sites in American media. Instead, they created \\\"dot-net\\\" sites that are virtually identical but offer no real money wagering. The sites advertise as poker schools or ways to learn the game for free, and feature words to the effect of \\\"this is not a gambling website.\\\"\\n\\nOn October 13, 2006, [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] officially signed into law the [[SAFE Port Act]], a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] aimed at enhancing security at U.S. ports.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/business/2006/10/13/safe-ports-act-biz-logistics-cx_rm_1013ports.html |title=Bush Signs Safe Port Act |publisher=Forbes |date=2006-10-13 |accessdate=2009-03-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018043515/http://www.forbes.com/business/2006/10/13/safe-ports-act-biz-logistics-cx_rm_1013ports.html|archivedate=2006-10-18}}</ref> Attached to the Safe Port Act was a provision known as the [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006]] (UIGEA). According to the UIGEA, \\\"unlawful internet gambling\\\" means to place, receive, or otherwise knowingly transmit a bet or wager by means of the internet where such bet is unlawful under any law in the State in which the bet is initiated, received, or otherwise made. Thus, the UIGEA prohibits online gambling sites from performing transactions with American financial institutions. As a result of the bill, several large publicly traded poker gaming sites such as [[PartyPoker]], [[Cassava Enterprises|PacificPoker]] and [[bwin]] closed down their US-facing operations. The UIGEA has had a devastating effect on the stock value of these companies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whichpoker.com/stats/UIGEAEffects |title=UIGEA Safe Port Act Legislation effect on Online Poker Rooms |publisher=WhichPoker |accessdate=2009-03-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227075802/http://www.whichpoker.com/stats/UIGEAEffects |archivedate=2009-02-27 }}</ref> Some poker sites, such as [[PokerStars]], [[Full Tilt Poker]], [[Absolute Poker]], continued to operate and remained open to US players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/1487-pokerstars-will-keep-serving-american-customers |title=PokerStars Will Keep Serving American Customers |publisher=CardPlayer |date=2006-10-12 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}</ref>\\n\\nFollowing passage of UIGEA, former U.S. Senator [[Al D'Amato]] joined the [[Poker Players Alliance]] (PPA).

The move blocks regulations to implement the legislation which requires the financial services sector to comply with ambiguous and burdensome rules in an attempt to prevent unlawful Internet gambling transactions.\\n\\nOn July 28, 2010, the [[House Financial Services Committee]] passed H.R. 2267 by a vote of 41\\u201322\\u20131.

First, there is the [[rake (poker)|rake]]. Similar to the [[Vigorish|vig]] paid to a [[Bookmaker|bookie]], the rake is a fee paid to the [[Casino|house]] for hosting the game. Rake is collected from most real money [[Cash game|ring game]] pots. The rake is normally calculated as a percentage of the pot based on a sliding scale and capped at some maximum fee. Each online poker room determines its own rake structure. Since the expenses for running an online poker table are smaller than those for running a live poker table, rake in most online poker rooms is much smaller than its brick and mortar counterpart.\\n\\nSecond, hands played in pre-scheduled multi-table and impromptu [[sit and go|sit-and-go]] [[poker tournament|tournaments]] are not raked, but rather an entry fee around five to ten percent of the tournament buy-in is added to the entry cost of the tournament. These two are usually specified in the tournament details as, e.g., $20+$2 ($20 represents the buy-in that goes into the prize pool and $2 represents the entry fee, de facto rake). Unlike real casino tournaments, online tournaments do not deduct dealer tips and other expenses from the prize pool.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thedailypoker.com/online-poker/how-online-poker-rooms-profit/ | title=How online poker rooms profit? | publisher=The Daily Poker |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205065713/http://www.thedailypoker.com/online-poker/how-online-poker-rooms-profit/|archive-date=2008-12-05 |access-date=2017-02-13 }}</ref>\\n\\nThird, some online poker sites also offer side games like [[blackjack]], [[roulettes]], or side bets on poker hands where the player plays against \\\"the house\\\" for real money.<ref>{{cite web|title=Side Games|url=http://www.mergegaming.com/side-games.html|publisher=Merge Gaming|accessdate=8 April 2014}}</ref> The odds are in the house's favor in these games, thus producing a profit for the house. Some sites go as far as getting affiliated with [[online casino]]s, or even integrating them into the poker room software.\\n\\nFourth, like almost all institutions that hold money, online poker sites invest the money that players deposit. Regulations in most jurisdictions exist in an effort to limit the sort of risks sites can take with their clients' money. However, since the sites do not have to pay interest on players' bankrolls even low-risk investments can be a significant source of revenue.\\n\\n==Integrity and fairness==\\n===Randomness of the shuffle===\\nMany critics question whether the operators of such games - especially those located in jurisdictions separate from most of their players - might be engaging in fraud themselves.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pokernews.com/news/2013/11/todd-witteles-discusses-poker-fraud-alert-cheating-more-16878.htm | title=Todd \\\"DanDruff\\\" Witteles Discusses PokerFraudAlert, Cheating in Poker & Much More | publisher=Pokernews | date=26 November 2013 | accessdate=29 March 2014 | author=Holloway, Chad}}</ref>\\n\\nInternet discussion forums are rife with allegations of non-random card dealing, possibly to favour house-employed players or \\\"[[computer game bot|bot]]s\\\" (poker-playing software disguised as a human opponent), or to give multiple players good hands thus increasing the bets and the rake, or simply to prevent new players from losing so quickly that they become discouraged. However, despite [[anecdotal evidence]] to support such claims, others argue that the rake is sufficiently large that such abuses would be unnecessary and foolish. Attempts at manipulative dealing could face a risk of third party detection due to increasingly sophisticated tracking software that could be used to detect any number of unusual patterns, though such analyses are not generally available in the public domain.\\n\\nMany players claim to see lots of \\\"bad beats\\\" with large hands pitted against others all too often at a rate that seems to be a lot more common than in live games. However, this could be caused by the higher hands per hour at on-line cardrooms. Since online players get to see more hands, their likelihood of seeing more improbable bad beats or randomly large pots is similarly increased.\\n\\nMany online poker sites are certified by major auditing firms like [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] to review the fairness of the [[random number generator]], [[shuffle]], and payouts for some sites.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ENMVgzDt1MEC&pg=PA23|title=Winning at Internet Poker For Dummies|last=Harlan|first=Mark|last2=Derossi|first2=Chris|date=2011-04-27|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=|isbn=9781118070000|location=|pages=23|language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref>\\n\\n===Insider cheating===\\nInsider [[cheating]] can occur when a person with trusted access to the system (e.g. an employee of the poker room) uses their position to play poker himself with an unfair advantage. This could be done without the knowledge of the site managers.\\n\\nPerhaps the first known major case came to light in October 2007, when [[Absolute Poker]] acknowledged that its integrity had been breached by an employee, who had been able to play at high stakes while viewing his opponents' hidden \\\"hole\\\" cards.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21381022 |title=Online poker cheating blamed on employee |publisher=NBC News |date=2007-10-19 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref> The cheating was first brought to light by the efforts of players, whose saved histories of play showed the employee was playing as only someone who could see their opponents' cards could.<ref>{{cite web|last=Levitt |first=Steven D. |url=http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/20/how-not-to-cheat/ |title=How Not to Cheat - Freakonomics Blog - NYTimes.com |publisher=Freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2007-09-20 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>\\n\\nIn 2008, [[UltimateBet]] became embroiled in a similar scandal, with former employees accused of using a [[backdoor (computing)|software backdoor]] to see opponents' cards. UltimateBet confirmed the allegations on May 29.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/26563848 |title=Poker site cheating plot a high-stakes whodunit |publisher=NBC News |date=2008-09-18 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref> The [[Kahnawake Gaming Commission]] announced sanctions against UltimateBet as a result.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokernews.com/news/2008/09/kahnawake-announces-ultimate-bet-sanctions.htm |title=Kahnawake Gaming Commission Announces Sanctions on UltimateBet: Russ Hamilton Named |publisher=Pokernews.com |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>\\n\\n===Collusion===\\nMore mundane cheating involves collusion between players, or the use of multiple accounts by a single player. Collusion is not limited to online play but can occur in any poker game with three or more players. Most poker rooms claim to actively scan for such activity. For example, in 2007, [[PokerStars]] disqualified [[TheV0id]], the winner of the main event of the [[World Championship of Online Poker]] for breaching their terms of service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/2892-poker-stars-wcoop-main-event-winner-disqualified|title=Card Player Magazine |publisher=Cardplayer.com |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>\\n\\n==Differences compared with conventional poker==\\nThere are substantial differences between online poker gaming and conventional, live gaming.\\n\\nOne obvious difference is that players do not sit right across from each other, removing any ability to observe others' reactions and [[body language]]. Instead, online poker players learn to focus more keenly on opponents' betting patterns, reaction time, speed of play, use of check boxes/auto plays, opponents' fold/flop percentages, chat box, waiting for the big blind, beginners' tells, and other behavior [[Tell (poker)|tells]] that are not physical in nature. Since poker is a game that requires adaptability, successful online players learn to master the new frontiers of their surroundings.\\n\\nAnother less obvious difference is the rate of play. In brick and mortar casinos the dealer has to collect the cards, shuffle, and deal them after every hand. Due to this and other delays common in offline casinos, the average rate of play is around thirty hands per hour. However, online casinos do not have these delays. The dealing and shuffling are instantaneous, there are no delays relating to counting chips (for a split pot), and on average the play is faster due to \\\"auto-action\\\" buttons (where the player selects his action before his turn). It is not uncommon for an online poker table to average ninety to one hundred hands per hour.\\n\\nThere are many ways in which online poker is considerably cheaper to play than conventional poker. While the rake structures of online poker sites might not differ fundamentally from those in brick and mortar operations, most of the other incidental expenses that are entailed by playing poker in a live room do not exist in online poker. An online poker player can play at home and thus incur no transportation costs to get to and from the poker room. Provided the player already has a somewhat modern computer and an Internet connection, there are no further up-front equipment costs to get started. There are also considerable incidental expenses once on a live poker table. In addition to the rake, [[gratuity|tipping]] the dealers, chip runners, servers and other casino employees is almost universally expected, putting a further drain on a player's profits. Also, whereas an online player can enter and leave tables almost as he pleases, once seated at a live table a player must remain there until he wishes to stop playing, or else go back to the bottom of the waiting list. [[Food]] and [[beverage]]s at casinos are generally expensive even compared to other hospitality establishments in the same city, let alone compared to at home, and casino managers feel little incentive to provide any complimentary food or drink for poker players.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\\n\\nIn the brick and mortar casinos, the only real way a player can increase his earnings is to increase his limit, likely encountering better opponents in the process. In the online world, players have another option: play more tables. Unlike a traditional casino where it is physically impossible to play at more than one table at a time, most online poker rooms permit this. Depending on the site and the player's ability to make speedy decisions, a player might play several tables at the same time, viewing them each in a separate window on the computer display. For example, an average profit around $10 per 100 hands at a low-limit game is generally considered to be good play. In a casino, this would earn a player under $4 an hour. After dealer tips, the \\\"winning\\\" player would probably barely break even before any other incidental expenses. In an online poker room, a player with the same win rate playing a relatively easy pace of four tables at once at a relatively sluggish 60 hands per hour each earns about $24/hour on average. The main restriction limiting the number of tables a player can play is the need to make consistently good decisions within the allotted time at every table, but some online players can effectively play up to eight or more tables at once. This can not only increase winnings but can also help to keep a player's income reasonably stable, since instead of staking his entire bankroll on one higher limit table he is splitting his bankroll, wins and losses amongst many lower limit tables, probably also encountering somewhat less skilled opponents in the process.\\n\\nAnother important difference results from the fact that some online poker rooms offer online poker schools that teach the basics and significantly speed up the learning curve for novices. Many online poker rooms also provide free money play so that players may practice these skills in various poker games and limits without the risk of losing real money, and generally offer the hand history of played hands for analysis and discussion using a [[Poker tools|poker hand converter]]. People who previously had no way to learn and improve because they had no one to play with now have the ability to learn the game much quicker and gain experience from free-money play.\\n\\nThe limits associated with online poker range down to far lower levels than the [[table limit]]s at a traditional casino. The [[marginal cost]] of opening each online table is so minuscule that on some gambling sites players can find limits as low as $.01\\u2013$.02. By comparison, at most brick and mortar establishments the lowest limits are often $1\\u2013$2.\\n\\nFew (if any) online poker sites allow action to be taken \\\"in the [[Poker terms#D|dark]]\\\", while this is usually allowed and applied by players in real gaming houses. It is also not uncommon for online poker sites to not allow a player the option of showing their hand before folding if they are the giving up the pot to the last remaining bettor. This practice is also typically allowed in casinos.\\n\\n===Currency issues===\\nOne issue exclusive to online poker is the fact that players come from around the world and deal in a variety of currencies. This is not an issue in live poker where everyone present can be expected to carry the local currency. Most online poker sites operate games exclusively in [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]], even if they do not accept players based in the United States. There are two methods by which poker sites can cater to players who do not deal with U.S. dollars on a regular basis.\\n\\nThe first method is to hold players' funds in their native currencies and convert them only when players enter and leave games. The main benefit of this method for players is to ensure that bankrolls are not subject to [[exchange rate]] fluctuations against their local currencies while they are not playing. Also, most sites that use this method usually apply the same exchange rate when a player cashes out of a game as when he bought in, ensuring that players do not expend significant sums simply by entering and leaving games.\\n\\nThe other method is to require players to convert their funds when depositing them. However, some sites that use this policy do accept payments in a variety of currencies and convert funds at a lower premium compared to what [[bank]]s and [[credit card]] companies would charge. Others only accept payment in U.S. dollars. One benefit of this method is that a player who constantly \\\"tops up\\\" his chip stack to a constant level (some poker rooms have an optional feature that can perform this function automatically) does not have to worry about rounding issues when topping up with a nominal sum \\u2013 these could add up over time.\\n\\nPlayers may also make use of [[Digital wallet|ewallets]], virtual wallets that will allow players to store their funds online in the currency of their choice. This allows them to deposit at poker sites without worrying about further currency conversion.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pokerfuse.com/features/comment-analysis/ach-and-ewallets-provide-deposit-solutions-for-online-gaming-sites-in-new-jersey-05-12/ | title=ACH and eWallets Provide Deposit Solutions for Online Gaming Sites in New Jersey | publisher=Pokerfuse | date=5 December 2013 | accessdate=29 March 2014 | author=Gentile, Michael}}</ref>\\n\\nMany online poker sites, particularly those that serve the United States, began adopting [[cryptocurrencies]] in 2013 as a means of bypassing the [[UIGEA]]. The majority of these poker rooms accept deposits in [[Bitcoin]] and then convert them to U.S. dollars, performing this process in reverse when paying out winnings. There also exist cryptocurrency-only operators who denominate their games in Bitcoin or fractions of a bitcoin, avoiding [[fiat currencies]] entirely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://professionalrakeback.com/bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-provide-payment-processing-solutions-for-online-gaming-sites|title=Cryptocurrencies Provide New Processing Channels for Online Gambling Operators|author=Singh, Michael|publisher=ProfessionalRakeback|date=29 January 2017|accessdate=5 August 2017}}</ref>\\n\\n===Poker tools===\\n{{main|Poker tools}}\\nVarious types of useful [[poker tools|software applications]] are available for online play. Such tools include hand database programs that save, sort, and recall all hand histories played online. Scanning the active tables for known players and displaying previous statistics from hands with those players next to their name(known as a Heads up display or HUD) is a common feature of these programs and is allowed by most sites. Other programs include hand re-players and odds, equity or variance calculators. Some software goes as far as to provide you with quizzes, or scan your previously played hands and flag likely mistakes.\\n\\n==Bonuses==\\nMany online poker sites offer incentives to players, especially new depositors, in the form of bonuses. Usually, the bonuses are paid out incrementally as certain amounts are raked by the player. For example, a site may offer a player who deposits $100 a bonus of $50 that awards $5 every time the player rakes $25. To earn the full $50 bonus sum, the player would have to [[Rake (poker)|rake]] $250 in total.\\n\\nIn addition, several online cardrooms have developed VIP programs to reward regular players. Poker rooms often offer additional bonuses for players who wish to top-up their accounts. These are known as reload bonuses.\\n\\nMany online rooms also offer [[rakeback]] and some offer poker propping.\\n\\nSee the [[Online casino#Bonuses|online casino]] article for more on general information on bonuses.\\n\\n== Compatibility ==\\nOnline poker rooms typically operate through a separate piece of software. This may be cross-platform, for example using a [[Java applet]] or [[WebGL]], allowing the program to run equally well on various computer systems such as [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[macOS]]. However, many online poker rooms offer downloadable programs designed only for Microsoft Windows which require a compatibility layer such as [[Wine (software)|Wine]] to run on [[Macintosh]] or [[Linux]] computers. Some sites do make available clients that run natively on Mac or Linux.\\n\\nSome poker rooms have started offering poker on portable devices ([[mobile phone]]s, [[smart phone]]s, [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s). The functionality of mobile online poker software is much the same as computer-based clients, albeit adapted to the interface of mobile devices. The player must be able to receive a WiFi or cell phone signal in order to play.\\n\\n== See also ==\\n*[[Computer poker players]]\\n*[[:Category:Poker companies|Poker companies]]\\n\\n==Notes==\\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n<!--========================({{No More Links}})============================\\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

It has been partly responsible for a huge increase in the number of poker players worldwide. Christiansen Capital Advisors stated online poker revenues grew from $82.7 million in 2001 to $2.4 billion in 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/56438 |title=Going All In For Online Poker |publisher=Newsweek |date=2005-08-15 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref> while a survey carried out by DrKW and Global Betting and Gaming Consultants asserted online poker revenues in 2004 were at $1.4 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto062720050064003754 |title=Financial Times: Online Poker 2004 revenues and 2008 forecast |publisher=Us.ft.com |date=2003-08-28 |accessdate=2009-03-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520074854/http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto062720050064003754 |archivedate=2009-05-20 }}</ref> In a testimony before the [[United States Senate]] regarding Internet Gaming, Grant Eve, a Certified Public Accountant representing the US Accounting Firm [[Joseph Eve, Certified Public Accountants]], estimated that one in every four dollars gambled is gambled online.<ref name=Joseph>{{cite web|last=Eve|first=Grant|title=Grant Eve Testimony 111711 - United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs|url=http://www.indian.senate.gov/hearings/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&pageid=9698|work=The Future of Internet Gaming|accessdate=11 January 2013}}</ref>\\n\\n==Overview==\\nTraditional (or \\\"[[brick and mortar]]\\\", B&M, live, land-based) venues for playing poker, such as [[casino]]s and poker rooms, may be intimidating for novice players and are often located in geographically disparate locations. Also, brick and mortar casinos are reluctant to promote poker because it is difficult for them to profit from it. Though the [[Rake (poker)|rake]], or time charge, of traditional casinos is often high, the [[opportunity cost]]s of running a poker room are even higher. Brick and mortar casinos often make much more money by removing poker rooms and adding more [[slot machine]]s. For example, figures from the Gaming Accounting Firm [[Joseph Eve, Certified Public Accountants|Joseph Eve]] estimate that poker accounts for 1% of brick and mortar casino revenues.<ref name=Joseph /> [[File:PokerTableOpenSource.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Screenshot of [[open-source]] [[PokerTH]] table]]\\n\\nOnline venues, by contrast, are dramatically cheaper because they have much smaller overhead costs. For example, adding another table does not take up valuable space like it would for a brick and mortar casino. Online poker rooms also allow the players to play for low stakes (as low as 1\\u00a2/2\\u00a2) and often offer poker [[Freeroll (poker)|freeroll]] tournaments (where there is no entry fee), attracting beginners and/or less wealthy clientele.\\n\\nOnline venues may be more vulnerable to certain types of [[fraud]], especially [[collusion]] between players. However, they have collusion detection abilities that do not exist in brick and mortar casinos. For example, online poker room security employees can look at the [[hand history]] of the cards previously played by any player on the site, making patterns of behavior easier to detect than in a casino where colluding players can simply fold their hands without anyone ever knowing the strength of their holding. Online poker rooms also check players' [[IP address]]es in order to prevent players at the same household or at known [[open proxy]] servers from playing on the same tables. Digital [[device fingerprinting]] also allows poker sites to recognize and block players who create new accounts in attempts to circumvent prior account bans, restrictions and closures.\\n\\n== History ==\\nFree poker online was played as early as the late 1990s in the form of [[IRC poker]]. [[Planet Poker]] was the first online card room to offer real money games in 1998. The first real money poker game was dealt on January 1, 1998. Author [[Mike Caro]] became the \\\"face\\\" of Planet Poker in October 1999.\\n\\nThe major online poker sites offer varying features to entice new players. One common feature is to offer tournaments called satellites by which the winners gain entry to real-life poker tournaments. It was through one such tournament on [[PokerStars]] that [[Chris Moneymaker]] won his entry to the [[2003 World Series of Poker]]. He went on to win the main event, causing shock in the poker world, and beginning the [[poker boom]]. The 2004 World Series featured three times as many players as in 2003. At least four players in the WSOP final table won their entry through an online cardroom. Like Moneymaker, 2004 winner [[Greg Raymer]] also won his entry at the [[PokerStars]] online cardroom.\\n\\nIn October 2004, [[Sportingbet]], at the time the world's largest publicly traded online gaming company (SBT.L), announced the acquisition of [[Sportingbet|ParadisePoker.com]], one of the online poker industry's first and largest cardrooms. The $340 million acquisition marked the first time an online card room was owned by a public company. Since then, several other card room parent companies have gone public.\\n\\nIn June 2005, [[PartyGaming]], the parent company of the then-largest online cardroom, PartyPoker, went public on the [[London Stock Exchange]], achieving an [[initial public offering]] market value in excess of $8 billion. At the time of the IPO, ninety-two percent of Party Gaming's income came from poker operations.\\n\\nIn early 2006, PartyGaming moved to acquire EmpirePoker.com from [[Empire Online]].

The pandemic is believed to have directed both professional and recreational players who normally prefer live poker to online platforms due the indefinite closure of most casinos and other live gaming venues worldwide, with even many [[Underground poker|unlicensed venues]] shutting down. In addition, the sudden dearth of live entertainment options due to the widespread disruption of the sports and entertainment schedules around the world is believed to have resulted in more than the usual number of casual players turning to online poker as an alternative. Many operators reported traffic of double or more the previous volume, depending on the time of day.\\n\\n==Legality==\\nFrom a legal perspective, online poker may differ in some ways from online casino gambling. However, many of the same issues do apply.

However, many legal experts [[Online gambling#General legal issues|dispute the DOJ's claim]].\\n\\nIn response to this and other claims by the DOJ regarding the legality of online poker, many of the major online poker sites stopped advertising their \\\"dot-com\\\" sites in American media.

The sites advertise as poker schools or ways to learn the game for free, and feature words to the effect of \\\"this is not a gambling website.\\\"\\n\\nOn October 13, 2006, [[George W.

Thus, the UIGEA prohibits online gambling sites from performing transactions with American financial institutions.

First, there is the [[rake (poker)|rake]]. Similar to the [[Vigorish|vig]] paid to a [[Bookmaker|bookie]], the rake is a fee paid to the [[Casino|house]] for hosting the game. Rake is collected from most real money [[Cash game|ring game]] pots. The rake is normally calculated as a percentage of the pot based on a sliding scale and capped at some maximum fee. Each online poker room determines its own rake structure. Since the expenses for running an online poker table are smaller than those for running a live poker table, rake in most online poker rooms is much smaller than its brick and mortar counterpart.\\n\\nSecond, hands played in pre-scheduled multi-table and impromptu [[sit and go|sit-and-go]] [[poker tournament|tournaments]] are not raked, but rather an entry fee around five to ten percent of the tournament buy-in is added to the entry cost of the tournament. These two are usually specified in the tournament details as, e.g., $20+$2 ($20 represents the buy-in that goes into the prize pool and $2 represents the entry fee, de facto rake). Unlike real casino tournaments, online tournaments do not deduct dealer tips and other expenses from the prize pool.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thedailypoker.com/online-poker/how-online-poker-rooms-profit/ | title=How online poker rooms profit? | publisher=The Daily Poker |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205065713/http://www.thedailypoker.com/online-poker/how-online-poker-rooms-profit/|archive-date=2008-12-05 |access-date=2017-02-13 }}</ref>\\n\\nThird, some online poker sites also offer side games like [[blackjack]], [[roulettes]], or side bets on poker hands where the player plays against \\\"the house\\\" for real money.<ref>{{cite web|title=Side Games|url=http://www.mergegaming.com/side-games.html|publisher=Merge Gaming|accessdate=8 April 2014}}</ref> The odds are in the house's favor in these games, thus producing a profit for the house. Some sites go as far as getting affiliated with [[online casino]]s, or even integrating them into the poker room software.\\n\\nFourth, like almost all institutions that hold money, online poker sites invest the money that players deposit. Regulations in most jurisdictions exist in an effort to limit the sort of risks sites can take with their clients' money. However, since the sites do not have to pay interest on players' bankrolls even low-risk investments can be a significant source of revenue.\\n\\n==Integrity and fairness==\\n===Randomness of the shuffle===\\nMany critics question whether the operators of such games - especially those located in jurisdictions separate from most of their players - might be engaging in fraud themselves.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pokernews.com/news/2013/11/todd-witteles-discusses-poker-fraud-alert-cheating-more-16878.htm | title=Todd \\\"DanDruff\\\" Witteles Discusses PokerFraudAlert, Cheating in Poker & Much More | publisher=Pokernews | date=26 November 2013 | accessdate=29 March 2014 | author=Holloway, Chad}}</ref>\\n\\nInternet discussion forums are rife with allegations of non-random card dealing, possibly to favour house-employed players or \\\"[[computer game bot|bot]]s\\\" (poker-playing software disguised as a human opponent), or to give multiple players good hands thus increasing the bets and the rake, or simply to prevent new players from losing so quickly that they become discouraged. However, despite [[anecdotal evidence]] to support such claims, others argue that the rake is sufficiently large that such abuses would be unnecessary and foolish. Attempts at manipulative dealing could face a risk of third party detection due to increasingly sophisticated tracking software that could be used to detect any number of unusual patterns, though such analyses are not generally available in the public domain.\\n\\nMany players claim to see lots of \\\"bad beats\\\" with large hands pitted against others all too often at a rate that seems to be a lot more common than in live games. However, this could be caused by the higher hands per hour at on-line cardrooms. Since online players get to see more hands, their likelihood of seeing more improbable bad beats or randomly large pots is similarly increased.\\n\\nMany online poker sites are certified by major auditing firms like [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] to review the fairness of the [[random number generator]], [[shuffle]], and payouts for some sites.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ENMVgzDt1MEC&pg=PA23|title=Winning at Internet Poker For Dummies|last=Harlan|first=Mark|last2=Derossi|first2=Chris|date=2011-04-27|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=|isbn=9781118070000|location=|pages=23|language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref>\\n\\n===Insider cheating===\\nInsider [[cheating]] can occur when a person with trusted access to the system (e.g. an employee of the poker room) uses his position to play poker himself with an unfair advantage. This could be done without the knowledge of the site managers.\\n\\nPerhaps the first known major case came to light in October 2007, when [[Absolute Poker]] acknowledged that its integrity had been breached by an employee, who had been able to play at high stakes while viewing his opponents' hidden \\\"hole\\\" cards.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21381022 |title=Online poker cheating blamed on employee |publisher=NBC News |date=2007-10-19 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref> The cheating was first brought to light by the efforts of players, whose saved histories of play showed the employee was playing as only someone who could see their opponents' cards could.<ref>{{cite web|last=Levitt |first=Steven D. |url=http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/20/how-not-to-cheat/ |title=How Not to Cheat - Freakonomics Blog - NYTimes.com |publisher=Freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2007-09-20 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>\\n\\nIn 2008, [[UltimateBet]] became embroiled in a similar scandal, with former employees accused of using a [[backdoor (computing)|software backdoor]] to see opponents' cards. UltimateBet confirmed the allegations on May 29.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/26563848 |title=Poker site cheating plot a high-stakes whodunit |publisher=NBC News |date=2008-09-18 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref> The [[Kahnawake Gaming Commission]] announced sanctions against UltimateBet as a result.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokernews.com/news/2008/09/kahnawake-announces-ultimate-bet-sanctions.htm |title=Kahnawake Gaming Commission Announces Sanctions on UltimateBet: Russ Hamilton Named |publisher=Pokernews.com |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>\\n\\n===Collusion===\\nMore mundane cheating involves collusion between players, or the use of multiple accounts by a single player. Collusion is not limited to online play but can occur in any poker game with three or more players. Most poker rooms claim to actively scan for such activity. For example, in 2007, [[PokerStars]] disqualified [[TheV0id]], the winner of the main event of the [[World Championship of Online Poker]] for breaching their terms of service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/2892-poker-stars-wcoop-main-event-winner-disqualified|title=Card Player Magazine |publisher=Cardplayer.com |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>\\n\\n==Differences compared with conventional poker==\\nThere are substantial differences between online poker gaming and conventional, live gaming.\\n\\nOne obvious difference is that players do not sit right across from each other, removing any ability to observe others' reactions and [[body language]]. Instead, online poker players learn to focus more keenly on opponents' betting patterns, reaction time, speed of play, use of check boxes/auto plays, opponents' fold/flop percentages, chat box, waiting for the big blind, beginners' tells, and other behavior [[Tell (poker)|tells]] that are not physical in nature. Since poker is a game that requires adaptability, successful online players learn to master the new frontiers of their surroundings.\\n\\nAnother less obvious difference is the rate of play. In brick and mortar casinos the dealer has to collect the cards, shuffle, and deal them after every hand. Due to this and other delays common in offline casinos, the average rate of play is around thirty hands per hour. However, online casinos do not have these delays. The dealing and shuffling are instantaneous, there are no delays relating to counting chips (for a split pot), and on average the play is faster due to \\\"auto-action\\\" buttons (where the player selects his action before his turn). It is not uncommon for an online poker table to average ninety to one hundred hands per hour.\\n\\nThere are many ways in which online poker is considerably cheaper to play than conventional poker. While the rake structures of online poker sites might not differ fundamentally from those in brick and mortar operations, most of the other incidental expenses that are entailed by playing poker in a live room do not exist in online poker. An online poker player can play at home and thus incur no transportation costs to get to and from the poker room. Provided the player already has a somewhat modern computer and an Internet connection, there are no further up-front equipment costs to get started. There are also considerable incidental expenses once on a live poker table. In addition to the rake, [[gratuity|tipping]] the dealers, chip runners, servers and other casino employees is almost universally expected, putting a further drain on a player's profits. Also, whereas an online player can enter and leave tables almost as he pleases, once seated at a live table a player must remain there until he wishes to stop playing, or else go back to the bottom of the waiting list. [[Food]] and [[beverage]]s at casinos are generally expensive even compared to other hospitality establishments in the same city, let alone compared to at home, and casino managers feel little incentive to provide any complimentary food or drink for poker players.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\\n\\nIn the brick and mortar casinos, the only real way a player can increase his earnings is to increase his limit, likely encountering better opponents in the process. In the online world, players have another option: play more tables. Unlike a traditional casino where it is physically impossible to play at more than one table at a time, most online poker rooms permit this. Depending on the site and the player's ability to make speedy decisions, a player might play several tables at the same time, viewing them each in a separate window on the computer display. For example, an average profit around $10 per 100 hands at a low-limit game is generally considered to be good play. In a casino, this would earn a player under $4 an hour. After dealer tips, the \\\"winning\\\" player would probably barely break even before any other incidental expenses. In an online poker room, a player with the same win rate playing a relatively easy pace of four tables at once at a relatively sluggish 60 hands per hour each earns about $24/hour on average. The main restriction limiting the number of tables a player can play is the need to make consistently good decisions within the allotted time at every table, but some online players can effectively play up to eight or more tables at once. This can not only increase winnings but can also help to keep a player's income reasonably stable, since instead of staking his entire bankroll on one higher limit table he is splitting his bankroll, wins and losses amongst many lower limit tables, probably also encountering somewhat less skilled opponents in the process.\\n\\nAnother important difference results from the fact that some online poker rooms offer online poker schools that teach the basics and significantly speed up the learning curve for novices. Many online poker rooms also provide free money play so that players may practice these skills in various poker games and limits without the risk of losing real money, and generally offer the hand history of played hands for analysis and discussion using a [[Poker tools|poker hand converter]]. People who previously had no way to learn and improve because they had no one to play with now have the ability to learn the game much quicker and gain experience from free-money play.\\n\\nThe limits associated with online poker range down to far lower levels than the [[table limit]]s at a traditional casino. The [[marginal cost]] of opening each online table is so minuscule that on some gambling sites players can find limits as low as $.01\\u2013$.02. By comparison, at most brick and mortar establishments the lowest limits are often $1\\u2013$2.\\n\\nFew (if any) online poker sites allow action to be taken \\\"in the [[Poker terms#D|dark]]\\\", while this is usually allowed and applied by players in real gaming houses. It is also not uncommon for online poker sites to not allow a player the option of showing their hand before folding if they are the giving up the pot to the last remaining bettor. This practice is also typically allowed in casinos.\\n\\n===Currency issues===\\nOne issue exclusive to online poker is the fact that players come from around the world and deal in a variety of currencies. This is not an issue in live poker where everyone present can be expected to carry the local currency. Most online poker sites operate games exclusively in [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]], even if they do not accept players based in the United States. There are two methods by which poker sites can cater to players who do not deal with U.S. dollars on a regular basis.\\n\\nThe first method is to hold players' funds in their native currencies and convert them only when players enter and leave games. The main benefit of this method for players is to ensure that bankrolls are not subject to [[exchange rate]] fluctuations against their local currencies while they are not playing. Also, most sites that use this method usually apply the same exchange rate when a player cashes out of a game as when he bought in, ensuring that players do not expend significant sums simply by entering and leaving games.\\n\\nThe other method is to require players to convert their funds when depositing them. However, some sites that use this policy do accept payments in a variety of currencies and convert funds at a lower premium compared to what [[bank]]s and [[credit card]] companies would charge. Others only accept payment in U.S. dollars. One benefit of this method is that a player who constantly \\\"tops up\\\" his chip stack to a constant level (some poker rooms have an optional feature that can perform this function automatically) does not have to worry about rounding issues when topping up with a nominal sum \\u2013 these could add up over time.\\n\\nPlayers may also make use of [[Digital wallet|ewallets]], virtual wallets that will allow players to store their funds online in the currency of their choice. This allows them to deposit at poker sites without worrying about further currency conversion.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pokerfuse.com/features/comment-analysis/ach-and-ewallets-provide-deposit-solutions-for-online-gaming-sites-in-new-jersey-05-12/ | title=ACH and eWallets Provide Deposit Solutions for Online Gaming Sites in New Jersey | publisher=Pokerfuse | date=5 December 2013 | accessdate=29 March 2014 | author=Gentile, Michael}}</ref>\\n\\nMany online poker sites, particularly those that serve the United States, began adopting [[cryptocurrencies]] in 2013 as a means of bypassing the [[UIGEA]]. The majority of these poker rooms accept deposits in [[Bitcoin]] and then convert them to U.S. dollars, performing this process in reverse when paying out winnings. There also exist cryptocurrency-only operators who denominate their games in Bitcoin or fractions of a bitcoin, avoiding [[fiat currencies]] entirely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://professionalrakeback.com/bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-provide-payment-processing-solutions-for-online-gaming-sites|title=Cryptocurrencies Provide New Processing Channels for Online Gambling Operators|author=Singh, Michael|publisher=ProfessionalRakeback|date=29 January 2017|accessdate=5 August 2017}}</ref>\\n\\n===Poker tools===\\n{{main|Poker tools}}\\nVarious types of useful [[poker tools|software applications]] are available for online play. Such tools include hand database programs that save, sort, and recall all hand histories played online. Scanning the active tables for known players and displaying previous statistics from hands with those players next to their name(known as a Heads up display or HUD) is a common feature of these programs and is allowed by most sites. Other programs include hand re-players and odds, equity or variance calculators. Some software goes as far as to provide you with quizzes, or scan your previously played hands and flag likely mistakes.\\n\\n==Bonuses==\\nMany online poker sites offer incentives to players, especially new depositors, in the form of bonuses. Usually, the bonuses are paid out incrementally as certain amounts are raked by the player. For example, a site may offer a player who deposits $100 a bonus of $50 that awards $5 every time the player rakes $25. To earn the full $50 bonus sum, the player would have to [[Rake (poker)|rake]] $250 in total.\\n\\nIn addition, several online cardrooms have developed VIP programs to reward regular players. Poker rooms often offer additional bonuses for players who wish to top-up their accounts. These are known as reload bonuses.\\n\\nMany online rooms also offer [[rakeback]] and some offer poker propping.\\n\\nSee the [[Online casino#Bonuses|online casino]] article for more on general information on bonuses.\\n\\n== Compatibility ==\\nOnline poker rooms typically operate through a separate piece of software. This may be cross-platform, for example using a [[Java applet]] or [[WebGL]], allowing the program to run equally well on various computer systems such as [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[macOS]]. However, many online poker rooms offer downloadable programs designed only for Microsoft Windows which require a compatibility layer such as [[Wine (software)|Wine]] to run on [[Macintosh]] or [[Linux]] computers. Some sites do make available clients that run natively on Mac or Linux.\\n\\nSome poker rooms have started offering poker on portable devices ([[mobile phone]]s, [[smart phone]]s, [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s). The functionality of mobile online poker software is much the same as computer-based clients, albeit adapted to the interface of mobile devices. The player must be able to receive a WiFi or cell phone signal in order to play.\\n\\n== See also ==\\n*[[Computer poker players]]\\n*[[:Category:Poker companies|Poker companies]]\\n\\n==Notes==\\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n<!--========================({{No More Links}})============================\\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

Such processes could include water or wind erosion, sedimentation, hydrothermal mechanisms, volcanism, and cratering.\\n* Perform calibration and validation of surface observations made by [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] instruments. This will help determine the accuracy and effectiveness of various instruments that survey [[Geology of Mars|Martian geology]] from orbit.\\n* Search for iron-containing minerals, identify and quantify relative amounts of specific mineral types that contain water or were formed in water, such as iron-bearing carbonates.\\n* Characterize the [[mineralogy]] and textures of rocks and soils and determine the processes that created them.\\n* Search for geological clues to the [[Environmental science|environmental conditions]] that existed when liquid water was present.\\n* Assess whether those environments were conducive to life.\\n\\nNASA sought evidence of life on Mars, beginning with the question of whether the Martian environment was ever suitable for life.

It was the highest resolution image taken on the surface of another planet. According to the camera designer Jim Bell of [[Cornell University]], the panoramic mosaic consists of four pancam images high by three wide. The picture shown originally had a full size of 4,000 by 3,000 [[pixels]]. However, a complete pancam panorama is even 8 times larger than that, and could be taken in stereo (i.e., two complete pictures, making the resolution twice as large again.) The colors are fairly accurate. (For a technical explanation, see [http://areo.info/mer/ colors outside the range of the human eye].)\\n\\nThe MER pancams are black-and-white instruments. Thirteen rotating filter wheels produce multiple images of the same scene at different wavelengths.

The next day the rover radioed a 7.8 bit/s beep, confirming that it had received a transmission from Earth but indicating that the craft believed it was in a fault mode. Commands would only be responded to intermittently. This was described as a very serious anomaly, but potentially recoverable if it were a software or memory corruption issue rather than a serious hardware failure. ''Spirit'' was commanded to transmit engineering data, and on January 23 sent several short low-bitrate messages before finally transmitting 73 megabits via [[X band]] to ''[[Mars Odyssey]]''. The readings from the engineering data suggested that the rover was not staying in sleep mode. As such, it was wasting its battery energy and overheating \\u2013 risk factors that could potentially destroy the rover if not fixed soon. On sol 20, the command team sent it the command SHUTDWN_DMT_TIL (\\\"Shutdown Dammit Until\\\") to try to cause it to suspend itself until a given time. It seemingly ignored the command.\\n\\nThe leading theory at the time was that the rover was stuck in a \\\"reboot loop\\\". The rover was programmed to reboot if there was a fault aboard. However, if there was a fault that occurred during reboot, it would continue to reboot forever. The fact that the problem persisted through reboot suggested that the error was not in RAM, but in either the [[flash memory]], the [[EEPROM]], or a hardware fault. The last case would likely doom the rover. Anticipating the potential for errors in the flash memory and EEPROM, the designers had made it so that the rover could be booted without ever touching the flash memory. The radio itself could decode a limited command set \\u2013 enough to tell the rover to reboot without using flash. Without access to flash memory the reboot cycle was broken.\\n\\nOn January 24, 2004 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|24}}) the rover repair team announced that the problem was with ''Spirit'''s flash memory and the software that wrote to it. The flash hardware was believed to be working correctly but the file management module in the software was \\\"not robust enough\\\" for the operations the ''Spirit'' was engaged in when the problem occurred, indicating that the problem was caused by a software bug as opposed to faulty hardware. NASA engineers finally came to the conclusion that there were too many files on the file system, which was a relatively minor problem. Most of these files contained unneeded in-flight data. After realizing what the problem was, the engineers deleted some files, and eventually reformatted the entire flash memory system. On February 6 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|02|06}}), the rover was restored to its original working condition, and science activities resumed.<ref name=\\\"planetary\\\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719212649/http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000702/ Planetary Blog].</ref>\\n\\n==== First intentional grinding of a rock on Mars ====\\n[[File:Rat post grind.jpg|thumb|right|Digital camera (the [[Pancam]]) image of a Mars rock (called [[Adirondack (Mars)|Adirondack]]) taken after a [[Rock Abrasion Tool|RAT]] grind (the rock grinding tool)]]\\nFor the first intentional grinding of a rock on Mars, the ''Spirit'' team chose a rock called \\\"[[Adirondack (Mars)|Adirondack]]\\\".

Adirondack was chosen over another rock called \\\"Sashimi\\\", which was closer to the rover, as Adirondack's surface was smoother, making it more suitable for the [[Rock Abrasion Tool]] (aka \\\"RAT\\\").<ref>{{cite press release |last=Webster |first=Guy |date=January 19, 2004 |title=Spirit Drives to a Rock Called 'Adirondack' for Close Inspection |url=https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mer/newsroom/pressreleases/20040119a.html |publisher=NASA |access-date=2018-01-02}}</ref>\\n\\n''Spirit'' made a small depression in the rock, {{convert|45.5|mm}} in diameter and {{convert|2.65|mm}} deep.

Raymond Arvidson, the McDonnell University Professor and chair of Earth and Planetary Sciences at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], reported during a NASA press conference: \\\"If we found this rock on Earth, we would say it is a volcanic rock that had a little fluid moving through it.\\\" In contrast to the rocks found by the twin rover ''Opportunity'', this one was formed from [[magma]] and then acquired bright material in small crevices, which look like crystallized minerals. If this interpretation holds true, the minerals were most likely dissolved in water, which was either carried inside the rock or interacted with it at a later stage, after it formed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20040305a.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover|last=mars.nasa.gov|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\\n\\n==== Bonneville crater ====\\nOn sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|03|11}} March 11, 2004, ''Spirit'' reached [[Bonneville (crater)|Bonneville crater]] after a {{convert|400|yd|m|adj=on|sp=us}} journey.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} This crater is about {{convert|200|m|yd|sp=us}} across with a floor about {{convert|10|m|yd|sp=us}} [[Crater depth|below]] the surface.<ref>{{cite web |title=Surfical geology of the Spirit rover traverse in Gusev Crater: dry and desiccating since the Hesperian |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/earlymars2004/pdf/8055.pdf |conference=Second Conference on Early Mars (2004) |accessdate=January 26, 2009 |author=Golombek|page=1 |quote=The rim is ~{{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us}} high and although the crater is shallow (~{{convert|10|m|ft|sp=us}} deep)|display-authors=etal}}</ref> JPL decided that it would be a bad idea to send the rover down into the crater, as they saw no targets of interest inside. ''Spirit'' drove along the southern rim and continued to the southwest towards the Columbia Hills.\\n{{wide image|PIA05591 Spirit's Destination (panorama).jpg|800px|Bonneville Crater}}\\n\\n''Spirit'' reached Missoula crater on sol 105. The crater is roughly {{convert|100|yd|m|sp=us}} across and {{convert|20|yd|m|sp=us}} deep. Missoula crater was not considered a high priority target due to the older rocks it contained. The rover skirted the northern rim, and continued to the southeast.\\nIt then reached Lahontan crater on sol 118, and drove along the rim until sol 120. Lahontan is about {{convert|60|yd|m|sp=us}} across and about {{convert|10|yd|m|sp=us}} deep. A long, snaking sand dune stretches away from its southwestern side, and ''Spirit'' went around it, because loose sand dunes present an unknown risk to the ability of the rover wheels to get traction.\\n\\n==== Columbia Hills ====\\n''Spirit'' drove from Bonneville crater in a direct line to the Columbia Hills. The route was only directly controlled by the engineers when the terrain was difficult to navigate; otherwise, the rover drove in an autonomous mode. On sol 159, ''Spirit'' reached the first of many targets at the base of the [[Columbia Hills (Mars)|Columbia Hills]] called West Spur. Hank's Hollow was studied for 23 sols. Within Hank's Hollow was the strange-looking rock dubbed \\\"[[Pot of Gold (Mars)|Pot of Gold]]\\\". Analysing this rock was difficult for Spirit, because it lay in a slippery area. After a detailed analysis with the AXPS-and the M\\u00f6\\u00dfbauer instrument it was detected that it contains hematite.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2004-161 | title = Mars Rovers Surprises Continue | work = JPL website | accessdate = 2006-10-06}}</ref> This kind of rock can  be built in connection with water.\\n\\nAs the produced energy from the solar panels was lowering due to the setting sun and dust the Deep Sleep Mode was introduced. In this mode the rover was shut down completely during the night in order to save energy, even if the instruments would fail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2004.html#sol171|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> The route was selected so that the rover's panels were tilted as much as possible towards the winter sun.\\n\\nFrom here, ''Spirit'' took a northerly path along the base of the hill towards the target Wooly Patch, which was studied from sol 192 to sol 199. By sol 203, ''Spirit'' had driven southward up the hill and arrived at the rock dubbed \\\"Clovis\\\". Clovis was ground and analyzed from sol 210 to sol 225. Following Clovis came the targets of Ebenezer (Sols 226\\u2013235), Tetl (sol 270), Uchben and Palinque (Sols 281\\u2013295), and Lutefisk (Sols 296\\u2013303). From Sols 239 to 262, ''Spirit'' powered down for [[solar conjunction]], when communications with the Earth are blocked. Slowly, ''Spirit'' made its way around the summit of Husband Hill, and at sol 344 was ready to climb over the newly designated \\\"Cumberland Ridge\\\" and into \\\"[[Larry's Lookout]]\\\" and \\\"Tennessee Valley\\\". ''Spirit'' also did some communication tests with the ESA orbiter ''[[Mars Express]]'' though most of the communication was usually done with the NASA orbiters ''[[2001 Mars Odyssey|Mars Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]''.\\n\\n=== 2005 ===\\n\\n==== Driving up to Husband Hill ====\\n''Spirit'' had now been on Mars for one Earth year and was driving slowly uphill towards the top of Husband Hill. This was difficult because there were many rocky obstacles and sandy parts. This lead frequently to a slippage and the route could not be driven as planned. In February ''Spirit'''s computer received a software update in order to drive more autonomously.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2005.html#sol416|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> On sol 371, ''Spirit'' arrived at a rock named \\\"Peace\\\" near the top of Cumberland Ridge. ''Spirit'' ground ''Peace'' with the RAT on sol 373. By sol 390 (mid-February 2005), ''Spirit'' was advancing towards \\\"Larry's Lookout\\\", by driving up the hill in reverse. The scientists at this time were trying to conserve as much energy as possible for the climb.\\n\\n''Spirit'' also investigated some targets along the way, including the soil target, \\\"Paso Robles\\\", which contained the highest amount of salt found on the red planet. The soil also contained a high amount of [[phosphorus]] in its composition, however not nearly as high as another rock sampled by ''Spirit'', \\\"Wishstone\\\". Squyres said of the discovery, \\\"We're still trying to work out what this means, but clearly, with this much salt around, water had a hand here\\\".\\n\\n<gallery class=\\\"center\\\">\\nImage:Pot of gold-Close-med.jpg|[[Pot of Gold (Mars)|Pot of Gold rock]]\\nImage:Gusev - Colina Husband.jpg|''Spirit'''s traverse up Husband Hill\\nImage:Spirit PIA03230.jpg|''Spirit'' artificially added to image (taken by itself) of Larry's Lookout\\nImage:MarsSunset.jpg|Martian sunset by ''Spirit'' at Gusev crater, May 19, 2005.\\n</gallery>\\n\\n==== Dust devils ====\\nOn March 9, 2005 (probably during the Martian night), the rover's solar panel efficiency jumped from the original ~60%  to 93%, followed on March 10, by the sighting of [[dust devils]]. NASA scientists speculate a dust devil must have swept the solar panels clean, possibly significantly extending the duration of the mission. This also marks the first time dust devils had been spotted by ''Spirit'' or ''Opportunity'', and is easily one of the top highlights of the mission to date. Dust devils had previously only been photographed by the ''[[Mars Pathfinder|Pathfinder]]'' probe.\\n\\nMission members monitoring ''Spirit'' on Mars reported on March 12, 2005 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2005|03|12}}), that a lucky encounter with a dust devil had cleaned the robot's solar panels. Energy levels dramatically increased and daily science work was anticipated to be expanded.<ref>{{cite web | last = David | first = Leonard | date = March 12, 2005 | url = http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/spirit_dust_050312.html | title = Spirit Gets A Dust Devil Once-Over | publisher = Space.com | accessdate =December 1, 2006}}</ref>\\n \\n[[File:Marsdustdevil2.gif|thumb|center|800px|Video of a dust devil on Mars, photographed by ''Spirit''.

The rover was the first spacecraft to climb atop a mountain on another planet. The whole distance driven totaled 4971 meters.\\nThe summit itself was flat. ''Spirit'' took a 360 degree panorama in real color, which included the whole Gusev crater.

This was an interesting target, but ''Spirit'' would be driven later to the McCool Hill to tilt its solar panels towards the sun in the coming winter. At the end of October the rover was driven downhill and to Home Plate. On the way down ''Spirit'' reached the rock formation named \\\"Comanche\\\" on sol 690. Scientists used data from all three spectrometers to find out that about one-fourth of the composition of Comanche is magnesium iron carbonate. That concentration is 10 times higher than for any previously identified carbonate in a Martian rock. Carbonates originate in wet, near-neutral conditions but dissolve in acid. The find at Comanche is the first unambiguous evidence from the Mars Exploration Mission rovers for a past Martian environment that may have been more favorable to life than the wet but acidic conditions indicated by the rovers' earlier finds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/multimedia/gallery/comanche-no-label.html|title=NASA \\u2013 Carbonate-Containing Martian Rocks (False Color)|website=www.nasa.gov}}</ref>\\n\\n{{Wide image|Everest Panorama from Mars.jpg|1100px|View from the Summit taken by ''Spirit'' on August 23, 2005, as the rover completed the climb up Husband Hill.}}\\n\\n=== 2006 ===\\n\\n==== Driving to McCool Hill ====\\nIn 2006 ''Spirit'' drove towards an area dubbed Home Plate, and reached it in February.

On March 16, 2006 JPL announced that ''Spirit's'' troublesome front wheel had stopped working altogether. Despite this, ''Spirit'' was still making progress toward McCool Hill because the control team programmed the rover to drive toward McCool Hill backwards, dragging its broken wheel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll.html#sol778|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>  In late March, ''Spirit'' encountered loose soil that was impeding its progress toward McCool Hill. A decision was made to terminate attempts to reach McCool Hill and instead park on a nearby ridge named Low Ridge Haven.\\n\\n{{multiple image\\n| align     = right \\n| direction = horizontal\\n| image1    = Home plate anim.gif\\n| width1    = {{#expr: (130 * 331 / 285 ) round 0}}\\n| alt1      = \\n| caption1  = Curious rock near edge of \\\"Home Plate\\\" with a jutting portion.

The rover made its first drive, a short turn to position targets of interest within reach of the robotic arm, in early November 2006, following the shortest days of winter and solar conjunction when communications with Earth were severely limited.\\n\\nWhile at Low Ridge, ''Spirit'' imaged two rocks of similar chemical nature to that of ''Opportunity'''s [[Heat Shield Rock]], a [[meteorite]] on the surface of Mars. Named \\\"Zhong Shan\\\" for [[Sun Yat-sen]] and \\\"Allan Hills\\\" for the [[Allan Hills|location]] in [[Antarctica]] where several Martian meteorites have been found, they stood out against the background rocks that were darker. Further spectrographic testing is being done to determine the exact composition of these rocks, which may turn out to also be meteorites.\\n\\n=== 2007 ===\\n\\n==== Software upgrade ====\\nOn January 4, 2007 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2007|01|04}}), both rovers received new flight software to the onboard computers. The update was received just in time for the third anniversary of their landing. The new systems let the rovers decide whether or not to transmit an image, and whether or not to extend their arms to examine rocks, which would save much time for scientists as they would not have to sift through hundreds of images to find the one they want, or examine the surroundings to decide to extend the arms and examine the rocks.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/01/04/tech-mars.html | work=CBC News | title=Old rovers learn new tricks | date=January 4, 2007}}</ref>\\n\\n====Silica Valley====\\n[[File:Spirit Mars Silica April 20 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Rover exposes silica-rich dust]]\\n''Spirit'''s dead wheel turned out to have a silver lining. As it was traveling in March 2007, pulling the dead wheel behind, the wheel scraped off the upper layer of the Martian soil, uncovering a patch of ground that scientists say shows evidence of a past environment that would have been perfect for microbial life. It is similar to areas on Earth where water or steam from hot springs came into contact with volcanic rocks. On Earth, these are locations that tend to teem with bacteria, said rover chief scientist [[Steve Squyres]]. \\\"We're really excited about this,\\\" he told a meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). The area is extremely rich in [[Silicon dioxide|silica]]\\u2013the main ingredient of window glass. The researchers have now concluded that the bright material must have been produced in one of two ways. One: hot-spring deposits produced when water dissolved silica at one location and then carried it to another (i.e. a geyser). Two: acidic steam rising through cracks in rocks  stripped them of their mineral components, leaving silica behind. \\\"The important thing is that whether it is one hypothesis or the other, the implications for the former habitability of Mars are pretty much the same,\\\" Squyres explained to BBC News. Hot water provides an environment in which [[microbe]]s can thrive and the precipitation of that silica entombs and preserves them. Squyres added, \\\"You can go to [[hot spring]]s and you can go to [[fumarole]]s and at either place on Earth it is teeming with life \\u2013 [[Microorganism|microbial life]].\\\"<ref name=\\\"Amos\\\">{{cite news  | last = Amos  | first = Jonathan    | title = Mars robot unearths microbe clue   | work = NASA says its robot rover Spirit has made one of its most significant discoveries on the surface of Mars. |publisher=BBC News  | date = December 11, 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7137793.stm  | accessdate =December 12, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=\\\"20071210a\\\">{{cite web  | last = Bertster  | first =  Guy   | title = Mars Rover Investigates Signs of Steamy Martian Past  | work = Press Release  | publisher = Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California  | date = December 10, 2007  | url = http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20071210a.html  | accessdate =December 12, 2007 }}</ref>\\n\\n==== Global dust storm and Home Plate ====\\nDuring 2007 ''Spirit'' spent several months near the base of the Home Plate plateau. On sol 1306 ''Spirit'' climbed onto the eastern edge of the plateau. In September and October it examined rocks and soils at several locations on the southern half of the plateau. On November 6, ''Spirit'' had reached the western edge of Home Plate, and started taking pictures for a panoramic overview of the western valley, with Grissom Hill and Husband Hill visible. The panorama image was published on NASA's website on January 3, 2008 to little attention, until January 23, when an independent website published a magnified detail of the image that showed a rock feature a few centimeters high resembling a humanoid figure seen from the side with its right arm partially raised.<ref>[http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001305/ Planetary.org] Emily Lakdawalla, ''Teeny little Bigfoot on Mars'', January 23, 2008 | 12:41 PST | 20:41 UTC</ref><ref>{{Cite APOD |date=January 29, 2008 |title=Spirit's West Valley Panorama image |access-date=}}</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Mars Spirit rover's solar panels covered with Dust - October 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Circular projection showing ''Spirit'''s solar panels covered in dust \\u2013 October 2007]]\\nTowards the end of June 2007, a series of dust storms began clouding the Martian atmosphere with dust. The storms intensified and by July 20, both ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' were facing the real possibility of system failure due to lack of energy. NASA released a statement to the press that said (in part) \\\"We're rooting for our rovers to survive these storms, but they were never designed for conditions this intense\\\".<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2007-080| accessdate=August 21, 2009| title=NASA Mars Rovers Braving Severe Dust Storms| date=July 27, 2007| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref> The key problem caused by the dust storms was a dramatic reduction in solar energy caused by there being so much dust in the atmosphere that it was blocking 99 percent of direct sunlight to ''Opportunity'', and slightly more to ''Spirit''.\\n\\nNormally the solar arrays on the rovers are able to generate up to {{Convert|700|Wh}} of energy per [[Martian day]].

If the batteries run dry, key electrical elements are likely to fail due to the intense cold. Both rovers were put into the lowest-power setting in order to wait out the storms. In early August the storms began to clear slightly, allowing the rovers to successfully charge their batteries.

It was expected that the level of dust cover on the solar panels would increase by 70 percent and that a slope of 30 degrees would be necessary to survive the winter. In February, a tilt of 29.9 degrees was achieved. Extra energy was available at times, and a high definition panorama named ''Bonestell'' was produced. At other times when there was only enough solar energy to recharge the batteries, communication with Earth was minimized and all unnecessary instruments were switched off. At winter solstice the energy production declined to 235 watt hours per sol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2008.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\\n\\n==== Winter dust storm ====\\nOn November 10, 2008, a large dust storm further reduced the output of the solar panels to {{Convert|89|Wh}} per day\\u2014a critically low level.<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20081110a.html |accessdate=August 21, 2009|title=Dust Storm Cuts Energy Supply of NASA Mars Rover Spirit| date= November 10, 2008| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref> NASA officials were hopeful that ''Spirit'' would survive the storm, and that the energy level would rise once the storm had passed and the skies started clearing.

However, in the Columbia Hills there was clear evidence for a moderate amount of aqueous weathering. The evidence included sulfates and the minerals goethite and carbonates that only form in the presence of water. It is believed that Gusev crater may have held a lake long ago, but it has since been covered by igneous materials. All the dust contains a magnetic component that was identified as magnetite with some titanium. Furthermore, the thin coating of dust that covers everything on Mars is the same in all parts of Mars.\\n\\n==Astronomy==\\n{{see also|Astronomy on Mars}}\\n{{multiple image\\n| align = right\\n| image1 = PIA05547-Spirit Rover-Earth seen from Mars.png\\n| width1 = {{#expr: (200 * (1194 / 1007)) round 0}}\\n| alt1 = \\n| caption1 = [[Earth]] from Mars\\n| image2 = Phobos & Deimos full thumb.png\\n| width2 = {{#expr: (200 * (200 / 213)) round 0}}\\n| alt2 = \\n| caption2 = Night sky of Mars showing [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] (left) and [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] (right) in front of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], as seen by [[Mars Exploration Rover]] ''Spirit'' on August 26, 2005.

It also took the first photo of Earth from the surface of another planet in early March 2004.\\n\\nIn late 2005, ''Spirit'' took advantage of a favorable energy situation to make multiple nighttime observations of both of Mars' moons [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]].<ref name=\\\"pancam\\\">Jim Bell (Cornell University) et al. [http://pancam.astro.cornell.edu/pancam_instrument/projects_2.html Pancam Projects: Spirit Night-time Imaging]. Retrieved 2008-10-21</ref> These observations included a \\\"[[lunar eclipse|lunar]]\\\" (or rather phobian) [[eclipse]] as ''Spirit'' watched Phobos disappear into Mars' shadow. Some of ''Spirit'''s star gazing was designed to look for a predicted [[meteor shower]] caused by [[Halley's Comet]], and although at least four imaged streaks were suspect meteors, they could not be unambiguously differentiated from those caused by cosmic rays.<ref name=\\\"pancam\\\" />\\n\\nA [[transit of Mercury from Mars]] took place on January 12, 2005 from about 14:45 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] to 23:05 UTC. Theoretically, this could have been observed by both ''Spirit'' and ''[[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]]''; however, camera resolution did not permit seeing Mercury's [[Arc second|6.1\\\"]] angular diameter. They were able to observe transits of [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] across the Sun, but at [[Arc minute|2']] angular diameter, Deimos is about 20 times larger than Mercury's 6.1\\\" angular diameter. Ephemeris data generated by [[JPL Horizons]] indicates that ''Opportunity'' would have been able to observe the transit from the start until local sunset at about 19:23 UTC Earth time, while ''Spirit'' would have been able to observe it from local sunrise at about 19:38 UTC until the end of the transit.{{Clarify|date=October 2008}}<!-- the nasa.gov URL does not state any of this; need instructions on how to verify this --><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons|title=HORIZONS System|first=Alan|last=Chamberlin|website=ssd.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\\n\\n==Equipment wear and failures==\\nBoth rovers passed their original mission time of 90 sols many times over.

Engineers began driving the rover backwards, dragging the dead wheel. Although this resulted in changes to driving techniques, the dragging effect became a useful tool, partially clearing away soil on the surface as the rover traveled, thus allowing areas to be imaged that would normally be inaccessible. However, in mid-December 2009, to the surprise of the engineers, the right front wheel showed slight movement in a wheel-test on sol 2113 and clearly rotated with normal resistance on three of four wheel-tests on sol 2117, but stalled on the fourth. On November 29, 2009 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2009|11|29}}), the right rear wheel also stalled and remained inoperable for the remainder of the mission.\\n\\nScientific instruments also experienced degradation as a result of exposure to the harsh Martian environment and use over a far longer period than had been anticipated by the mission planners.

It was the highest resolution image taken on the surface of another planet. According to the camera designer Jim Bell of [[Cornell University]], the panoramic mosaic consists of four pancam images high by three wide. The picture shown originally had a full size of 4,000 by 3,000 [[pixels]]. However, a complete pancam panorama is even 8 times larger than that, and could be taken in stereo (i.e., two complete pictures, making the resolution twice as large again.) The colors are fairly accurate. (For a technical explanation, see [http://areo.info/mer/ colors outside the range of the human eye].)\\n\\nThe MER pancams are black-and-white instruments. Thirteen rotating filter wheels produce multiple images of the same scene at different wavelengths.

The next day the rover radioed a 7.8 bit/s beep, confirming that it had received a transmission from Earth but indicating that the craft believed it was in a fault mode. Commands would only be responded to intermittently. This was described as a very serious anomaly, but potentially recoverable if it were a software or memory corruption issue rather than a serious hardware failure. ''Spirit'' was commanded to transmit engineering data, and on January 23 sent several short low-bitrate messages before finally transmitting 73 megabits via [[X band]] to ''[[Mars Odyssey]]''. The readings from the engineering data suggested that the rover was not staying in sleep mode. As such, it was wasting its battery energy and overheating \\u2013 risk factors that could potentially destroy the rover if not fixed soon. On sol 20, the command team sent it the command SHUTDWN_DMT_TIL (\\\"Shutdown Dammit Until\\\") to try to cause it to suspend itself until a given time. It seemingly ignored the command.\\n\\nThe leading theory at the time was that the rover was stuck in a \\\"reboot loop\\\". The rover was programmed to reboot if there was a fault aboard. However, if there was a fault that occurred during reboot, it would continue to reboot forever. The fact that the problem persisted through reboot suggested that the error was not in RAM, but in either the [[flash memory]], the [[EEPROM]], or a hardware fault. The last case would likely doom the rover. Anticipating the potential for errors in the flash memory and EEPROM, the designers had made it so that the rover could be booted without ever touching the flash memory. The radio itself could decode a limited command set \\u2013 enough to tell the rover to reboot without using flash. Without access to flash memory the reboot cycle was broken.\\n\\nOn January 24, 2004 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|24}}) the rover repair team announced that the problem was with ''Spirit'''s flash memory and the software that wrote to it. The flash hardware was believed to be working correctly but the file management module in the software was \\\"not robust enough\\\" for the operations the ''Spirit'' was engaged in when the problem occurred, indicating that the problem was caused by a software bug as opposed to faulty hardware. NASA engineers finally came to the conclusion that there were too many files on the file system, which was a relatively minor problem. Most of these files contained unneeded in-flight data. After realizing what the problem was, the engineers deleted some files, and eventually reformatted the entire flash memory system. On February 6 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|02|06}}), the rover was restored to its original working condition, and science activities resumed.<ref name=\\\"planetary\\\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719212649/http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000702/ Planetary Blog].</ref>\\n\\n==== First intentional grinding of a rock on Mars ====\\n[[File:Rat post grind.jpg|thumb|right|Digital camera (the [[Pancam]]) image of a Mars rock (called [[Adirondack (Mars)|Adirondack]]) taken after a [[Rock Abrasion Tool|RAT]] grind (the rock grinding tool)]]\\nFor the first intentional grinding of a rock on Mars, the ''Spirit'' team chose a rock called \\\"[[Adirondack (Mars)|Adirondack]]\\\".

It then turned in place to face the target rock and drove four short moves straightforward totaling {{cvt|1.9|m}}.

Raymond Arvidson, the McDonnell University Professor and chair of Earth and Planetary Sciences at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], reported during a NASA press conference: \\\"If we found this rock on Earth, we would say it is a volcanic rock that had a little fluid moving through it.\\\" In contrast to the rocks found by the twin rover ''Opportunity'', this one was formed from [[magma]] and then acquired bright material in small crevices, which look like crystallized minerals. If this interpretation holds true, the minerals were most likely dissolved in water, which was either carried inside the rock or interacted with it at a later stage, after it formed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20040305a.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover|last=mars.nasa.gov|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\\n\\n==== Bonneville crater ====\\nOn sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|03|11}} March 11, 2004, ''Spirit'' reached [[Bonneville (crater)|Bonneville crater]] after a {{convert|400|yd|m|adj=on|sp=us}} journey.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} This crater is about {{convert|200|m|yd|sp=us}} across with a floor about {{convert|10|m|yd|sp=us}} [[Crater depth|below]] the surface.<ref>{{cite web |title=Surfical geology of the Spirit rover traverse in Gusev Crater: dry and desiccating since the Hesperian |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/earlymars2004/pdf/8055.pdf |conference=Second Conference on Early Mars (2004) |accessdate=January 26, 2009 |author=Golombek|page=1 |quote=The rim is ~{{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us}} high and although the crater is shallow (~{{convert|10|m|ft|sp=us}} deep)|display-authors=etal}}</ref> JPL decided that it would be a bad idea to send the rover down into the crater, as they saw no targets of interest inside. ''Spirit'' drove along the southern rim and continued to the southwest towards the Columbia Hills.\\n{{wide image|PIA05591 Spirit's Destination (panorama).jpg|800px|Bonneville Crater}}\\n\\n''Spirit'' reached Missoula crater on sol 105. The crater is roughly {{convert|100|yd|m|sp=us}} across and {{convert|20|yd|m|sp=us}} deep. Missoula crater was not considered a high priority target due to the older rocks it contained. The rover skirted the northern rim, and continued to the southeast.\\nIt then reached Lahontan crater on sol 118, and drove along the rim until sol 120. Lahontan is about {{convert|60|yd|m|sp=us}} across and about {{convert|10|yd|m|sp=us}} deep. A long, snaking sand dune stretches away from its southwestern side, and ''Spirit'' went around it, because loose sand dunes present an unknown risk to the ability of the rover wheels to get traction.\\n\\n==== Columbia Hills ====\\n''Spirit'' drove from Bonneville crater in a direct line to the Columbia Hills. The route was only directly controlled by the engineers when the terrain was difficult to navigate; otherwise, the rover drove in an autonomous mode. On sol 159, ''Spirit'' reached the first of many targets at the base of the [[Columbia Hills (Mars)|Columbia Hills]] called West Spur. Hank's Hollow was studied for 23 sols. Within Hank's Hollow was the strange-looking rock dubbed \\\"[[Pot of Gold (Mars)|Pot of Gold]]\\\". Analysing this rock was difficult for Spirit, because it lay in a slippery area. After a detailed analysis with the AXPS-and the M\\u00f6\\u00dfbauer instrument it was detected that it contains hematite.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2004-161 | title = Mars Rovers Surprises Continue | work = JPL website | accessdate = 2006-10-06}}</ref> This kind of rock can  be built in connection with water.\\n\\nAs the produced energy from the solar panels was lowering due to the setting sun and dust the Deep Sleep Mode was introduced. In this mode the rover was shut down completely during the night in order to save energy, even if the instruments would fail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2004.html#sol171|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> The route was selected so that the rover's panels were tilted as much as possible towards the winter sun.\\n\\nFrom here, ''Spirit'' took a northerly path along the base of the hill towards the target Wooly Patch, which was studied from sol 192 to sol 199. By sol 203, ''Spirit'' had driven southward up the hill and arrived at the rock dubbed \\\"Clovis\\\". Clovis was ground and analyzed from sol 210 to sol 225. Following Clovis came the targets of Ebenezer (Sols 226\\u2013235), Tetl (sol 270), Uchben and Palinque (Sols 281\\u2013295), and Lutefisk (Sols 296\\u2013303). From Sols 239 to 262, ''Spirit'' powered down for [[solar conjunction]], when communications with the Earth are blocked. Slowly, ''Spirit'' made its way around the summit of Husband Hill, and at sol 344 was ready to climb over the newly designated \\\"Cumberland Ridge\\\" and into \\\"[[Larry's Lookout]]\\\" and \\\"Tennessee Valley\\\". ''Spirit'' also did some communication tests with the ESA orbiter ''[[Mars Express]]'' though most of the communication was usually done with the NASA orbiters ''[[2001 Mars Odyssey|Mars Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]''.\\n\\n=== 2005 ===\\n\\n==== Driving up to Husband Hill ====\\n''Spirit'' had now been on Mars for one Earth year and was driving slowly uphill towards the top of Husband Hill. This was difficult because there were many rocky obstacles and sandy parts. This lead frequently to a slippage and the route could not be driven as planned. In February ''Spirit'''s computer received a software update in order to drive more autonomously.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2005.html#sol416|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> On sol 371, ''Spirit'' arrived at a rock named \\\"Peace\\\" near the top of Cumberland Ridge. ''Spirit'' ground ''Peace'' with the RAT on sol 373. By sol 390 (mid-February 2005), ''Spirit'' was advancing towards \\\"Larry's Lookout\\\", by driving up the hill in reverse.

NASA scientists speculate a dust devil must have swept the solar panels clean, possibly significantly extending the duration of the mission. This also marks the first time dust devils had been spotted by ''Spirit'' or ''Opportunity'', and is easily one of the top highlights of the mission to date.

This was an interesting target, but ''Spirit'' would be driven later to the McCool Hill to tilt its solar panels towards the sun in the coming winter. At the end of October the rover was driven downhill and to Home Plate. On the way down ''Spirit'' reached the rock formation named \\\"Comanche\\\" on sol 690. Scientists used data from all three spectrometers to find out that about one-fourth of the composition of Comanche is magnesium iron carbonate. That concentration is 10 times higher than for any previously identified carbonate in a Martian rock. Carbonates originate in wet, near-neutral conditions but dissolve in acid. The find at Comanche is the first unambiguous evidence from the Mars Exploration Mission rovers for a past Martian environment that may have been more favorable to life than the wet but acidic conditions indicated by the rovers' earlier finds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/multimedia/gallery/comanche-no-label.html|title=NASA \\u2013 Carbonate-Containing Martian Rocks (False Color)|website=www.nasa.gov}}</ref>\\n\\n{{Wide image|Everest Panorama from Mars.jpg|1100px|View from the Summit taken by ''Spirit'' on August 23, 2005, as the rover completed the climb up Husband Hill.}}\\n\\n=== 2006 ===\\n\\n==== Driving to McCool Hill ====\\nIn 2006 ''Spirit'' drove towards an area dubbed Home Plate, and reached it in February.

The rover made its first drive, a short turn to position targets of interest within reach of the robotic arm, in early November 2006, following the shortest days of winter and solar conjunction when communications with Earth were severely limited.\\n\\nWhile at Low Ridge, ''Spirit'' imaged two rocks of similar chemical nature to that of ''Opportunity'''s [[Heat Shield Rock]], a [[meteorite]] on the surface of Mars. Named \\\"Zhong Shan\\\" for [[Sun Yat-sen]] and \\\"Allan Hills\\\" for the [[Allan Hills|location]] in [[Antarctica]] where several Martian meteorites have been found, they stood out against the background rocks that were darker.

The update was received just in time for the third anniversary of their landing. The new systems let the rovers decide whether or not to transmit an image, and whether or not to extend their arms to examine rocks, which would save much time for scientists as they would not have to sift through hundreds of images to find the one they want, or examine the surroundings to decide to extend the arms and examine the rocks.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/01/04/tech-mars.html | work=CBC News | title=Old rovers learn new tricks | date=January 4, 2007}}</ref>\\n\\n====Silica Valley====\\n[[File:Spirit Mars Silica April 20 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Rover exposes silica-rich dust]]\\n''Spirit'''s dead wheel turned out to have a silver lining. As it was traveling in March 2007, pulling the dead wheel behind, the wheel scraped off the upper layer of the Martian soil, uncovering a patch of ground that scientists say shows evidence of a past environment that would have been perfect for microbial life. It is similar to areas on Earth where water or steam from hot springs came into contact with volcanic rocks. On Earth, these are locations that tend to teem with bacteria, said rover chief scientist [[Steve Squyres]]. \\\"We're really excited about this,\\\" he told a meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). The area is extremely rich in [[Silicon dioxide|silica]]\\u2013the main ingredient of window glass. The researchers have now concluded that the bright material must have been produced in one of two ways. One: hot-spring deposits produced when water dissolved silica at one location and then carried it to another (i.e. a geyser). Two: acidic steam rising through cracks in rocks  stripped them of their mineral components, leaving silica behind. \\\"The important thing is that whether it is one hypothesis or the other, the implications for the former habitability of Mars are pretty much the same,\\\" Squyres explained to BBC News. Hot water provides an environment in which [[microbe]]s can thrive and the precipitation of that silica entombs and preserves them. Squyres added, \\\"You can go to [[hot spring]]s and you can go to [[fumarole]]s and at either place on Earth it is teeming with life \\u2013 [[Microorganism|microbial life]].\\\"<ref name=\\\"Amos\\\">{{cite news  | last = Amos  | first = Jonathan    | title = Mars robot unearths microbe clue   | work = NASA says its robot rover Spirit has made one of its most significant discoveries on the surface of Mars. |publisher=BBC News  | date = December 11, 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7137793.stm  | accessdate =December 12, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=\\\"20071210a\\\">{{cite web  | last = Bertster  | first =  Guy   | title = Mars Rover Investigates Signs of Steamy Martian Past  | work = Press Release  | publisher = Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California  | date = December 10, 2007  | url = http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20071210a.html  | accessdate =December 12, 2007 }}</ref>\\n\\n==== Global dust storm and Home Plate ====\\nDuring 2007 ''Spirit'' spent several months near the base of the Home Plate plateau.

The storms intensified and by July 20, both ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' were facing the real possibility of system failure due to lack of energy. NASA released a statement to the press that said (in part) \\\"We're rooting for our rovers to survive these storms, but they were never designed for conditions this intense\\\".<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2007-080| accessdate=August 21, 2009| title=NASA Mars Rovers Braving Severe Dust Storms| date=July 27, 2007| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref> The key problem caused by the dust storms was a dramatic reduction in solar energy caused by there being so much dust in the atmosphere that it was blocking 99 percent of direct sunlight to ''Opportunity'', and slightly more to ''Spirit''.\\n\\nNormally the solar arrays on the rovers are able to generate up to {{Convert|700|Wh}} of energy per [[Martian day]].

It was expected that the level of dust cover on the solar panels would increase by 70 percent and that a slope of 30 degrees would be necessary to survive the winter. In February, a tilt of 29.9 degrees was achieved. Extra energy was available at times, and a high definition panorama named ''Bonestell'' was produced. At other times when there was only enough solar energy to recharge the batteries, communication with Earth was minimized and all unnecessary instruments were switched off.

It is also possible that the rover had experienced a mission clock fault. If that had happened, the rover would have lost track of time and tried to remain asleep until enough sunlight struck the solar arrays to wake it. This state is called \\\"Solar Groovy.\\\" If the rover woke up from a mission clock fault, it would only listen. Starting on July 26, 2010 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2010|07|26}}), a new procedure to address the possible mission clock fault was implemented.\\n\\nEach sol, the Deep Space Network mission controllers sent a set of X-band \\\"Sweep & Beep\\\" commands. If the rover had experienced a mission clock fault and then had been awoken during the day, it would have listened during brief, 20-minute intervals during each hour awake.

However, in the Columbia Hills there was clear evidence for a moderate amount of aqueous weathering. The evidence included sulfates and the minerals goethite and carbonates that only form in the presence of water. It is believed that Gusev crater may have held a lake long ago, but it has since been covered by igneous materials.

After the defeat of [[Yue (state)|Yue]] by [[King Fuchai of Wu]], a garrison city was built {{Convert|12|m|abbr=on}} above the water level on the north bank of the Yangtze c.&nbsp;485&nbsp;BC.  This city in the shape of a three by three ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' square was named Hancheng.<ref>Schinz, 1996</ref> The newly built Han canal formed a moat around the south and east sides of the city. The purpose of Hancheng was to protect [[Suzhou]] from naval invasion from [[Qi (state)|Qi]]. During the [[Han dynasty]], Guangling was the seat of [[Guangling Commandery]]. It constituted a part of the [[Xu Province]], rather than the [[Yang Province]] (Yangzhou), which was covered the entire southeastern part of China then. In 590, the city was made the capital of a newly established [[Yang Prefecture (Jiangsu)|Yang Prefecture]], and began to be referred to with its current name.\\n\\nUnder [[Emperor Yang of Sui]] (r. 604\\u2013617), Yangzhou was the southern capital of China. It was called Jiangdu upon the completion of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] until the fall of the [[Sui dynasty]]. By the mid 610s, a combination of fruitless attempts to conquer the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo, together with natural disasters and provincial unrest, ensured many people Emperor Yang had lost the legitimacy of his monarchy. As revolts spread across China in 616, the Emperor abandoned the North and meanwhile withdrew to Jiangdu, where he remained until his assassination in 618.\\n\\n===Tang Dynasty===\\nThe city has remained a leading economic and cultural center and major port of foreign trade and external exchange since the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\\u2013907).

The riot that resulted was an angry crowd estimated at eight to ten thousand who assaulted the premises of the British [[OMF International|China Inland Mission]] in Yangzhou by looting, burning and attacking the missionaries led by [[Hudson Taylor]]. No one was killed, however several of the missionaries were injured as they were forced to flee for their lives. As a result of the report of the riot, the British consul in [[Shanghai]], [[Walter Henry Medhurst (consul)|Sir Walter Henry Medhurst]] took seventy [[Royal Marines]] in a [[man-of-war]] and steamed up the Yangtze to Nanjing in a controversial show of force that eventually resulted in an official apology from [[Viceroy]] [[Zeng Guofan]] and financial restitution made to the injured missionaries.\\n\\nFrom the time of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1853) to the beginning of the Reform Era (1980) Yangzhou was in decline, due to war damage, neglect of the Grand Canal as railways replaced it in importance, and stagnation in the early decades of the PRC. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], it endured eight years of enemy occupation and was used by the Japanese as a site for internment camps. About 1200 civilians of Allied nationalities (mostly British and Australian) from Shanghai were transported here in 1943, and located in one of three camps (A, B, and C). Camps B and C were closed down in September, 1943, after the second American-Japanese prisoner exchange, and their inhabitants transferred back to Shanghai camps.  Camp C, located in the former American Mission in the north-west of the city, was maintained for the duration of the war.<ref>Leck, Greg, ''Captives of Empire: The Japanese Internment of Allied Civilians in China'' Shandy Press, 2006; Antonia Finnane, ''Far From Where?

The city's status as a leading economic centre in China was never to be restored. Not until the 1990s did it begin to regain some semblance of prosperity, benefitting from national economic growth and a number of targeted development projects. With the canal now partially restored, and excellent rail and road connections, Yangzhou is once again an important transportation and market center. It also has some industrial output, chiefly in cotton and textiles. In 2004, a railway linked Yangzhou for the first time with Nanjing.\\n\\n==Geography==\\n[[File:Yangzhou five pavilion bridge.JPG|thumb|250px|The Five Pavilion Bridge over Shouxi Lake.]]\\nYangzhou is located on a plain north of the Yangtze. The Grand Canal, also known as the [[Beijing|Jing]]-[[Hangzhou|Hang]] Canal, crosses the prefecture-level from the north to the south; its modern route passes through the eastern outskirts of Yangzhou's main urban area, while its old route runs through the city center. Other major bodies of water within the prefecture-level city include the [[Baoshe River]], [[Datong River]], [[Beichengzi River]], [[Tongyang Canal]], [[Xintongyang Canal]], [[Baima Lake]], [[Baoying Lake]], [[Gaoyou Lake]] and [[Shaobo Lake]].\\n\\nLike much of the entire prefecture-level city, Yangzhou's main urban area (the \\\"city proper\\\") is criss-crossed by an intricate network of canals and small lakes. The historic city center (the former waled city) is surrounded by canals on all sides: the Old Grand Canal forms its eastern and southern boundaries; the City Moat Canal runs along the former walled city's northern edge, connecting the Old Grand Canal with the [[Slender West Lake]]; the Erdaohe Canal runs along the old city's western edge, from the Slender West Lake to the [[Hehuachi Park|Lotus Flower Pond]] (Hehuachi), which in its turn is connected by the short Erdaogou canal with the Old Grand Canal.<ref>[http://yangzhou.yztm.net/tnewsshow.asp?id=450 \\u53e4\\u8fd0\\u6cb3\\u2014\\u8377\\u82b1\\u6c60\\u2014\\u7626\\u897f\\u6e56\\u6c34\\u4e0a\\u6e38\\u89c8\\u7ebf\\u5168\\u90e8\\u8d2f\\u901a] (The Old Grand Canal \\u2013 Hehua Pond \\u2013 Thin West Lake tourist waterway is fully open), 2010-09-20</ref> It is possible to sail a small water craft from the Thin West Lake, via the Erdaohe, the Hehua Pond, and the Erdaogou into the Old Grand Canal.<ref>[http://www.yzcn.net/broadcast/pic/2011/0329/124850.shtml \\u7eff\\u6768\\u57ce\\u90ed\\u6c34\\u4e0a\\u6e384\\u00b718\\u4eae\\u76f8], 2011-3-29; see the map in this article</ref>\\n\\n==Climate==\\nYangzhou has a subtropical monsoon climate with humid changeable wind; longer winters for about 4 months, summers 3 months and shorter springs and autumns, 2 months respectively; frost-free period of 222 days and annual average sunshine of 2177 hours.\\n\\nThe mean annual temperature is {{convert|15.72|\\u00b0C|1}} annually; the normal monthly mean 24-hour temperature ranges from {{convert|2.5|\\u00b0C}} in January to {{convert|28.0|\\u00b0C}} in July.\\n\\nThe annual average precipitation is {{convert|1043|mm|abbr=on}}, and about 45 percent of rainfall is concentrated in the summer.

The average water depth is 15\\u201320 meters. In 1992, the State Council approved it to become a first-grade open state harbour, and General Secretary [[Jiang Zemin]] inscribed its name. Now, it has developed into a comprehensive [[inland harbor]], integrating passenger, freight, container transportation and harbour trade, and has become the main distribution center of northern Jiangsu province, eastern [[Anhui]] Province and southeast [[Shandong]] Province. There are several dozen categories of goods including iron and steel, timber, minerals, coal, grain, cotton, container, products of light industry and machinery. The passenger routes reach Nanjing, Wuhu, [[Jiujiang]], [[Huangshi]] and [[Wuhan]] in the west, and [[Nantong]] and [[Shanghai]] in the east. Some well-known luxury international liners also anchor here. The harbour has greatly promoted the development of exports and the overall local economy.\\n\\n===Expressways===\\n\\nThe Ningyang (Nanjing\\u2013Yangzhou) Expressway crosses the southern part of Yangzhou's metropolitan area while the Ningtong (Nanjing\\u2013Nantong) Expressway is connected to Yangzhou at Liaojiagou. In recent years, local government have attached great importance to the development of the tourism, in conjunction with a greater effort dedicated to the improvement of the local road transport system. With a total investment of 680 million yuan, the Yangzhou section of the Ningyang Expressway was completed on December 18, 1998 and opened to traffic in June 1999. Stretching nearly {{convert|18|km|abbr=on}}, the section of the expressway starts from the Bazi Flyover as the entry/exit, via the Yanggua Highway, the Tonggang Highway, an ancient canal, the Yangwei Highway, the Beijing\\u2013Hangzhou Grand Canal and the Yangling Highway, to Liqojiagou Entry/Exit of Yangjiang Highway. It then passes the Jiangdu Flyover to directly link up with the Huaijiang Expressway. In addition, the section of Huaijiang Expressway within the territory of Yangzhou began construction on March 22, 1997, which will be commonly used by the state planned Tongjiang\\u2013Sanya and Beijing\\u2013Shanghai trunk lines. The section of Huaijiang Expressway in Yangzhou totals {{convert|112.04|km|abbr=on}}in length, starting from Jinghe Town of Baoying in the north to the entry/exist of Zhuanqiaozhen Flyover of Jiangdu in the south. It then links with Ningtong Expressway, passing by three counties (cities) such as Baoying, Gaoyou and Jiangdu and 26 towns, at a total cost of 3.7 billion yuan. It is expected to be open to traffic by the year 2000.\\n[[File:Yangzhou-Modern-Grand-Canal-barge-caravan-3342.JPG|thumb|The modern route of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] passes within a few kilometers east of the city's main urban area]]\\n\\n===Intercity bus service===\\nDuring the daytime, frequent bus service operates between Yangzhou and nearby cities. There are several bus stations on the city's outskirts; most of the buses from [[Nanjing]] (Nanjing West Bus Station) and Zhenjiang (where the bus station is adjacent to the [[Zhenjiang Railway Station]]) arrive to Yangzhou South Bus Station, located a few kilometers southwest from downtown. Most of the intercity bus service stops in the early evening.\\n\\n===Transportation in the Urban Area===\\nThe city is served by an extensive network of public bus routes.\\n\\nYangzhou's taxi industry began in 1982, and has developed rapidly since 1993. the city has over 40 taxi companies of various ownership structures, with a total of 1,571 vehicles. Parking lots were established at key stations and hotels, and eight taxi companies have opened round-the-clock telephone service. The construction department of the municipal government has strengthened the management of taxi services, providing education in the relevant laws, professional ethics and safety aspects.\\n\\nIn 2014, Yangzhou's government approved plans for the construction of a subway system, which will initially include two lines. Line 1 will run in the general east-west direction, from Yangzhou Railway Station in the west to the historic central city to the future high-speed railway station (east of the Grand Canal) to [[Jiangdu District]].

They have an appealing color, aroma, taste and appearance. The original color of each ingredient is preserved after cooking, and no oily sauce is added, so as to retain the fresh flavour of the food.\\n\\nIn Yangzhou all dishes, whether cheap or expensive, are elaborate. Cooks will not scrimp on their work, even with [[dazhu gansi]] ({{zh|c=\\u5927\\u716e\\u5e72\\u4e1d|p=d\\u00e0zh\\u01d4 g\\u0101ns\\u012b}}), a popular dish that costs only a few yuan. Dry bean curd is made by each restaurant that serves it, so the flavor is guaranteed. The cook slices the 1-cm-thick curd into 30 shreds, each one paper-thin but none broken, and then stews them for hours with chopped bamboo shoots and shelled shrimps in chicken soup. In this way the dry bean curd shreds can soak up the flavor of the other ingredients, and the soup is clear but savory. Not only Yangzhou cooks, but also the ordinary people are conscientious about cooking.\\n\\n* [[Fu Chun Teahouse]]\\n* [[Yangzhou fried rice]], is said {{by whom|date=May 2014}} to have been invented by a person who was a former Yangzhou [[magistrate]].\\n\\n==Culture==\\n[[File:Yangzhou-childrens-library-scooter-parking-3411.jpg|thumb|Children's Library building, on the premises of Yangzhou Public Library]]\\nThe Yangzhou dialect ({{zh|c=\\u626c\\u5dde\\u8bdd|p=Y\\u00e1ngzh\\u014du hu\\u00e0|links=no}}) of Chinese is representative of [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin]], and is particularly close to the [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|official language]] of the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] courts, which was based on the [[Nanjing dialect]]. However, it does differ considerably from modern [[Standard Chinese]], although they are still moderately [[mutually intelligible]].\\n\\nDialect has also been used as a tool for regional identity and politics in the [[Jiangbei region|Jiangbei]] and [[Jiangnan]] regions. While the city of Yangzhou was the center of trade, flourishing and prosperous, it was considered part of Jiangnan, which was known to be wealthy, even though Yangzhou was north of the Yangzi river. Once Yangzhou's wealth and prosperity were gone, it was then considered to be part of Jiangbei, the \\\"backwater\\\". After Yangzhou was removed from Jiangnan, its residents decided{{dubious|date=January 2016}} to replace [[Jianghuai Mandarin]], which was the dialect of Yangzhou, with [[Taihu Wu dialects]]. In Jiangnan itself, multiple subdialects of Wu fought for the position of prestige dialect.<ref>{{cite book\\n | url=https://archive.org/details/teachersofinnerc00kodo\\n | url-access=registration\\n | title=Teachers of the inner chambers: women and culture in seventeenth-century China\\n | year=1994\\n | author=Dorothy Ko\\n | publisher=Stanford University Press\\n | edition=illustrated, annotated\\n | isbn=0-8047-2359-1\\n | page=[https://archive.org/details/teachersofinnerc00kodo/page/21 21]\\n | quote=With the exclusion of Yangzhou came the denigration of its dialect, a variant of Jianghuai \\\"Mandarin\\\" (guanhua).

The innovative painter-calligrapher [[Shitao]] lived in Yangzhou during the 1680s and again from 1697 until his death in 1707. A later group of painters from that time called the [[Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou]] are famous throughout China.\\n\\nFormer General secretary of CPC, President of China [[Jiang Zemin]] was born and raised in Yangzhou. His middle school is located right across from the public notary's office in Yangzhou.\\n\\nYangzhou is famous for its carved [[lacquerware]] and [[jade]].\\n\\nSome of China's most creative and eye catching dishes come from the Yangzhou school of cuisine called [[Huaiyang cuisine|Huaiyang]] (also commonly known as the Weiyang school).

Many tourists from neighboring cities travel to the city for its good-quality and low-priced toys.\\n\\nIt is worth mentioning that the city is also famous for an ancient folk art called Yangzhou storytelling ({{lang|zh-hans|\\u626c\\u5dde\\u8bc4\\u8bdd}}), which is like [[Xiangsheng]]\\u2014the traditional Chinese comedic performance. It rose as a performing act during the [[Ming Dynasty]]. In the performance, the artist details an interesting historical story to audiences, using Yangzhou dialect. These stories have been edited by artists, so they sound very soul-stirring and funny. The best known artist of Yangzhou storytelling was [[Wang shaotang]]. His most famous works are The 10 chapters of [[Wu Song]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\\u6b66\\u5341\\u56de}}), The 10 chapters of [[Song Jiang]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\\u5b8b\\u5341\\u56de}}), The 10 chapters of [[Lu Junyi]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\\u5362\\u5341\\u56de}}), and The 10 chapters of [[Shi Xiu]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\\u77f3\\u5341\\u56de}}).<ref>Vibeke B\\u00f8rdahl, The Oral Tradition of Yangzhou Storytelling, London: Routledge, 1996; Vibeke B\\u00f8rdahl and Jette Ross, Chinese Storytellers: Life and Art in the Yangzhou Tradition, Cheng and Tsui 2002.</ref>\\n[[File:Chinese snowball.jpg|right|thumb|Chinese snowball flowers]]\\n\\n===Literary references===\\nYangzhou was frequently referenced in Chinese literature.

A long bank planted with weeping willows spans the lake; at its midpoint stands a square terrace with pavilions at each of the corners and one in the center. Around the lake is a park in which are found several attractions: Lotus Flower Pagoda (Lianhua SO), a white structure reminiscent of the White Pagoda (Baita) in Beijing's Beihai Park; Small Gold Mountain (Xiao Jin Shan); and the Fishing Platform (Diaoyutai), a favorite retreat of the Qing emperor Qian Long. The emperor was so gratified by his luck in fishing at this spot that he ordered additional stipends for the town. As it turns out, his success had been augmented by local swimmers who lurked in the lake busily attaching fish to his hook.\\n\\n<gallery mode=\\\"packed\\\" heights=\\\"160px\\\">\\nImage:Serene and Fragrant Study.JPG|Study hall\\nImage:Si Qiao Yan Yu Building.jpg|Four bridges in rain and mist\\nImage:The Sunny Spring Stage.jpg|Imperial birthday celebration stage\\nImage:Du Mu 24 bridge poem.JPG|Mao Zedong's calligraphy of Tang dynasty poet Du Mu poem\\nImage:Twenty four bridge.JPG|24 ancient beauties played flute on this bridge\\nImage:White pagoda clear sky and cloud garden.JPG|Entrance to a garden\\nImage:Jinjingge copy.JPG|The jinjingge bridge\\nImage:Xu Garden.jpg|The Xu Garden\\n</gallery>\\n\\n===Daming Temple===\\n{{main|Daming Temple}}\\nLocated on Shugang Hill, in the city's northwest, is Fajing Temple, formerly known as DaMing Temple.

A recent addition to the temple complex is the [[Jianzhen]] Memorial Hall, built according to Tang Dynasty methods and financed with contributions raised by Buddhist groups in Japan.\\nWhen Qing Emperor Qian Long visited Yangzhou in 1765, he was troubled by The temple's name DaMing (which literally means \\\"Great Ming') fearing that it might revive nostalgia for the Ming Dynasty, which was overthrown by his Manchu predecessors. He had it renamed Fajing Temple.\\nThe temple was seriously damaged during the Taiping Rebellion at the beginning of the 20th century.

'''Yangchow''', is a [[prefecture-level city]] in central [[Jiangsu]] Province, China.

Its population was 4,414,681 at the 2010 census and its urban area is home to 2,146,980 inhabitants, including three urban districts, currently in the agglomeration.\\n\\nHistorically, Yangzhou was one of the wealthiest cities in China, known at various periods for its great merchant families, poets, artists, and scholars. Its name (<small>lit.</small> \\\"Rising Prefecture\\\") refers to its former position as the capital of the ancient [[Yangzhou (ancient China)|Yangzhou]] prefecture in [[History of the administrative divisions of China before 1912|imperial China]].

After the defeat of [[Yue (state)|Yue]] by [[King Fuchai of Wu]], a garrison city was built {{Convert|12|m|abbr=on}} above the water level on the north bank of the Yangtze c.&nbsp;485&nbsp;BC.  This city in the shape of a three by three ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' square was named Hancheng.<ref>Schinz, 1996</ref>  The newly built Han canal formed a moat around the south and east sides of the city. The purpose of Hancheng was to protect [[Suzhou]] from naval invasion from [[Qi (state)|Qi]]. During the [[Han dynasty]], Guangling was the seat of [[Guangling Commandery]]. It constituted a part of the [[Xu Province]], rather than the [[Yang Province]] (Yangzhou), which was covered the entire southeastern part of China then. In 590, the city was made the capital of a newly established [[Yang Prefecture (Jiangsu)|Yang Prefecture]], and began to be referred to with its current name.\\n\\nUnder [[Emperor Yang of Sui]] (r. 604\\u2013617), Yangzhou was the southern capital of China. It was called Jiangdu upon the completion of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] until the fall of the [[Sui dynasty]]. By the mid 610s, a combination of fruitless attempts to conquer the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo, together with natural disasters and provincial unrest, ensured many people Emperor Yang had lost the legitimacy of his monarchy. As revolts spread across China in 616, the Emperor abandoned the North and meanwhile withdrew to Jiangdu, where he remained until his assassination in 618.\\n\\n===Tang Dynasty===\\nThe city has remained a leading economic and cultural center and major port of foreign trade and external exchange since the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\\u2013907).

Although some versions of Polo's memoirs imply that he was the governor of Yangzhou, it is more likely that he was an official in the salt industry, if indeed he was employed there at all. Chinese texts offer no supporting evidence for his claim. The discovery of the 1342 tomb of [[Katarina Vilioni]], member of an Italian trading family in Yangzhou, does, however, suggest the existence of a thriving Italian community in the city in the 14th century.

As early as 1655, the Dutch envoy [[Johan Nieuhof]] described the city (''Jamcefu'', i.e. Yangzhou-Fu, in his transcription) commented on the city's salt trade as follows:<ref>[[Johan Nieuhof]],\\n''[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/DLDecArts/DLDecArts-idx?type=turn&entity=DLDecArts.Nieuhof.p0108 An embassy from the East-India Company of the United Provinces, to the Grand Tartar Cham, emperor of China: delivered by their excellencies Peter de Goyer and Jacob de Keyzer, at his imperial city of Peking wherein the cities, towns, villages, ports, rivers, &c. in their passages from Canton to Peking are ingeniously described by John Nieuhoff; ...

The riot that resulted was an angry crowd estimated at eight to ten thousand who assaulted the premises of the British [[OMF International|China Inland Mission]] in Yangzhou by looting, burning and attacking the missionaries led by [[Hudson Taylor]]. No one was killed, however several of the missionaries were injured as they were forced to flee for their lives. As a result of the report of the riot, the British consul in [[Shanghai]], [[Walter Henry Medhurst (consul)|Sir Walter Henry Medhurst]] took seventy [[Royal Marines]] in a [[man-of-war]] and steamed up the Yangtze to Nanjing in a controversial show of force that eventually resulted in an official apology from [[Viceroy]] [[Zeng Guofan]] and financial restitution made to the injured missionaries.\\n\\nFrom the time of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1853) to the beginning of the Reform Era (1980) Yangzhou was in decline, due to war damage, neglect of the Grand Canal as railways replaced it in importance, and stagnation in the early decades of the PRC. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], it endured eight years of enemy occupation and was used by the Japanese as a site for internment camps. About 1200 civilians of Allied nationalities (mostly British and Australian) from Shanghai were transported here in 1943, and located in one of three camps (A, B, and C). Camps B and C were closed down in September, 1943, after the second American-Japanese prisoner exchange, and their inhabitants transferred back to Shanghai camps.  Camp C, located in the former American Mission in the north-west of the city, was maintained for the duration of the war.<ref>Leck, Greg, ''Captives of Empire: The Japanese Internment of Allied Civilians in China'' Shandy Press, 2006; Antonia Finnane, ''Far From Where?

The city's status as a leading economic centre in China was never to be restored. Not until the 1990s did it begin to regain some semblance of prosperity, benefitting from national economic growth and a number of targeted development projects. With the canal now partially restored, and excellent rail and road connections, Yangzhou is once again an important transportation and market center. It also has some industrial output, chiefly in cotton and textiles. In 2004, a railway linked Yangzhou for the first time with Nanjing.\\n\\n==Geography==\\n[[File:Yangzhou five pavilion bridge.JPG|thumb|250px|The Five Pavilion Bridge over Shouxi Lake.]]\\nYangzhou is located on a plain north of the Yangtze. The Grand Canal, also known as the  [[Beijing|Jing]]-[[Hangzhou|Hang]] Canal, crosses the prefecture-level from the north to the south; its modern route passes through the eastern outskirts of Yangzhou's main urban area, while its old route runs through the city center. Other major bodies of water within the prefecture-level city include the [[Baoshe River]], [[Datong River]], [[Beichengzi River]], [[Tongyang Canal]], [[Xintongyang Canal]], [[Baima Lake]], [[Baoying Lake]], [[Gaoyou Lake]] and [[Shaobo Lake]].\\n\\nLike much of the entire prefecture-level city, Yangzhou's main urban area (the \\\"city proper\\\") is criss-crossed by an intricate network of canals and small lakes. The historic city center  (the former waled city) is surrounded by canals on all sides: the Old Grand Canal forms its eastern and southern boundaries; the City Moat Canal runs along the former walled city's northern edge, connecting the Old Grand Canal with the [[Slender West Lake]]; the Erdaohe Canal runs along the old city's western edge, from the Slender West Lake to the [[Hehuachi Park|Lotus Flower Pond]] (Hehuachi), which in its turn is connected by the short Erdaogou canal with the Old Grand Canal.<ref>[http://yangzhou.yztm.net/tnewsshow.asp?id=450 \\u53e4\\u8fd0\\u6cb3\\u2014\\u8377\\u82b1\\u6c60\\u2014\\u7626\\u897f\\u6e56\\u6c34\\u4e0a\\u6e38\\u89c8\\u7ebf\\u5168\\u90e8\\u8d2f\\u901a] (The Old Grand Canal - Hehua Pond - Thin West Lake tourist waterway is fully open), 2010-09-20</ref> It is possible to sail a small water craft from the Thin West Lake, via the Erdaohe, the Hehua Pond, and the Erdaogou into the Old Grand Canal.<ref>[http://www.yzcn.net/broadcast/pic/2011/0329/124850.shtml \\u7eff\\u6768\\u57ce\\u90ed\\u6c34\\u4e0a\\u6e384\\u00b718\\u4eae\\u76f8],  2011-3-29; see the map in this article</ref>\\n\\n==Climate==\\nYangzhou has a subtropical monsoon climate with humid changeable wind; longer winters for about 4 months, summers 3 months and shorter springs and autumns, 2 months respectively; frost-free period of 222 days and annual average sunshine of 2177 hours.\\n\\nThe mean annual temperature is {{convert|15.72|\\u00b0C|1}} annually; the normal monthly mean 24-hour temperature ranges from {{convert|2.5|\\u00b0C}} in January to {{convert|28.0|\\u00b0C}} in July.\\n\\nThe annual average precipitation is {{convert|1043|mm|abbr=on}}, and about 45 percent of rainfall is concentrated in the summer.

The average water depth is 15\\u201320 meters. In 1992, the State Council approved it to become a first-grade open state harbour, and General Secretary [[Jiang Zemin]] inscribed its name. Now, it has developed into a comprehensive [[inland harbor]], integrating passenger, freight, container transportation and harbour trade, and has become the main distribution center of northern Jiangsu province, eastern [[Anhui]] Province and southeast [[Shandong]] Province. There are several dozen categories of goods including iron and steel, timber, minerals, coal, grain, cotton, container, products of light industry and machinery. The passenger routes reach Nanjing, Wuhu, [[Jiujiang]], [[Huangshi]] and [[Wuhan]] in the west, and [[Nantong]] and [[Shanghai]] in the east.

In recent years, local government have attached great importance to the development of the tourism, in conjunction with a greater effort dedicated to the improvement of the local road transport system. With a total investment of 680 million yuan, the Yangzhou section of the Ningyang Expressway was completed on December 18, 1998 and opened to traffic in June 1999.

They have an appealing color, aroma, taste and appearance. The original color of each ingredient is preserved after cooking, and no oily sauce is added, so as to retain the fresh flavour of the food.\\n\\nIn Yangzhou all dishes, whether cheap or expensive, are elaborate. Cooks will not scrimp on their work, even with [[dazhu gansi]] ({{zh|c=\\u5927\\u716e\\u5e72\\u4e1d|p=d\\u00e0zh\\u01d4 g\\u0101ns\\u012b}}), a popular dish that costs only a few yuan. Dry bean curd is made by each restaurant that serves it, so the flavor is guaranteed. The cook slices the 1-cm-thick curd into 30 shreds, each one paper-thin but none broken, and then stews them for hours with chopped bamboo shoots and shelled shrimps in chicken soup. In this way the dry bean curd shreds can soak up the flavor of the other ingredients, and the soup is clear but savory. Not only Yangzhou cooks, but also the ordinary people are conscientious about cooking.\\n\\n* [[Fu Chun Teahouse]]\\n* [[Yangzhou fried rice]], is said {{by whom|date=May 2014}} to have been invented by a person who was a former Yangzhou [[magistrate]].\\n\\n==Culture==\\n[[File:Yangzhou-childrens-library-scooter-parking-3411.jpg|thumb|Children's Library building, on the premises of Yangzhou Public Library]]\\nThe Yangzhou dialect ({{zh|c=\\u626c\\u5dde\\u8bdd|p=Y\\u00e1ngzh\\u014du hu\\u00e0|links=no}}) of Chinese is representative of [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin]], and is particularly close to the [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|official language]] of the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] courts, which was based on the [[Nanjing dialect]]. However, it does differ considerably from modern [[Standard Chinese]], although they are still moderately [[mutually intelligible]].\\n\\nDialect has also been used as a tool for regional identity and politics in the [[Jiangbei region|Jiangbei]] and [[Jiangnan]] regions. While the city of Yangzhou was the center of trade, flourishing and prosperous, it was considered part of Jiangnan, which was known to be wealthy, even though Yangzhou was north of the Yangzi river. Once Yangzhou's wealth and prosperity were gone, it was then considered to be part of Jiangbei, the \\\"backwater\\\". After Yangzhou was removed from Jiangnan, its residents decided{{dubious|date=January 2016}} to replace [[Jianghuai Mandarin]], which was the dialect of Yangzhou, with [[Taihu Wu dialects]]. In Jiangnan itself, multiple subdialects of Wu fought for the position of prestige dialect.<ref>{{cite book\\n | url=https://archive.org/details/teachersofinnerc00kodo\\n | url-access=registration\\n | title=Teachers of the inner chambers: women and culture in seventeenth-century China\\n | volume=\\n | year=1994\\n | author=Dorothy Ko\\n | publisher=Stanford University Press\\n | edition=illustrated, annotated\\n | location=\\n | isbn=0-8047-2359-1\\n | page=[https://archive.org/details/teachersofinnerc00kodo/page/21 21]\\n | pages=\\n | quote=With the exclusion of Yangzhou came the denigration of its dialect, a variant of Jianghuai \\\"Mandarin\\\" (guanhua).

The innovative painter-calligrapher [[Shitao]] lived in Yangzhou during the 1680s and again from 1697 until his death in 1707. A later group of painters from that time called the [[Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou]] are famous throughout China.\\n\\nFormer General secretary of CPC, President of China [[Jiang Zemin]] was born and raised in Yangzhou. His middle school is located right across from the public notary's office in Yangzhou.\\n\\nYangzhou is famous for its carved [[lacquerware]] and [[jade]].\\n\\nSome of China's most creative and eye catching dishes come from the Yangzhou school of cuisine called [[Huaiyang cuisine|Huaiyang]] (also commonly known as the Weiyang school).

Many tourists from neighboring cities travel to the city for its good-quality and low-priced toys.\\n\\nIt is worth mentioning that the city is also famous for an ancient folk art called Yangzhou storytelling ({{lang|zh-hans|\\u626c\\u5dde\\u8bc4\\u8bdd}}), which is like [[Xiangsheng]]\\u2014the traditional Chinese comedic performance. It rose as a performing act during the [[Ming Dynasty]]. In the performance, the artist details an interesting historical story to audiences, using Yangzhou dialect. These stories have been edited by artists, so they sound very soul-stirring and funny. The best known artist of Yangzhou storytelling was [[Wang shaotang]]. His most famous works are The 10 chapters of [[Wu Song]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\\u6b66\\u5341\\u56de}}), The 10 chapters of [[Song Jiang]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\\u5b8b\\u5341\\u56de}}), The 10 chapters of [[Lu Junyi]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\\u5362\\u5341\\u56de}}), and The 10 chapters of [[Shi Xiu]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\\u77f3\\u5341\\u56de}}).<ref>Vibeke B\\u00f8rdahl, The Oral Tradition of Yangzhou Storytelling, London: Routledge, 1996; Vibeke B\\u00f8rdahl and Jette Ross, Chinese Storytellers: Life and Art in the Yangzhou Tradition, Cheng and Tsui 2002.</ref>\\n[[File:Chinese snowball.jpg|right|thumb|Chinese snowball flowers]]\\n\\n===Literary references===\\nYangzhou was frequently referenced in Chinese literature.

Most of the Historic city is in the Guangling District.\\n\\n===Slender West Lake===\\n{{main|Slender West Lake}}\\nNamed after Hangzhou's famous West Lake, this long, narrow stretch of water which meanders through Yangzhou's western limits is a well-known scenic spot. A long bank planted with weeping willows spans the lake; at its midpoint stands a square terrace with pavilions at each of the corners and one in the center. Around the lake is a park in which are found several attractions: Lotus Flower Pagoda (Lianhua SO), a white structure reminiscent of the White Pagoda (Baita) in Beijing's Beihai Park; Small Gold Mountain (Xiao Jin Shan); and the Fishing Platform (Diaoyutai), a favorite retreat of the Qing emperor Qian Long. The emperor was so gratified by his luck in fishing at this spot that he ordered additional stipends for the town. As it turns out, his success had been augmented by local swimmers who lurked in the lake busily attaching fish to his hook.\\n\\n<gallery mode=\\\"packed\\\" heights=\\\"160px\\\">\\nImage:Serene and Fragrant Study.JPG|Study hall\\nImage:Si Qiao Yan Yu Building.jpg|Four bridges in rain and mist\\nImage:The Sunny Spring Stage.jpg|Imperial birthday celebration stage\\nImage:Du Mu 24 bridge poem.JPG|Mao Zedong's calligraphy of Tang dynasty poet Du Mu poem\\nImage:Twenty four bridge.JPG|24 ancient beauties played flute on this bridge\\nImage:White pagoda clear sky and cloud garden.JPG|Entrance to a garden\\nImage:Jinjingge copy.JPG|The jinjingge bridge\\nImage:Xu Garden.jpg|The Xu Garden\\n</gallery>\\n\\n===Daming Temple===\\n{{main|Daming Temple}}\\nLocated on Shugang Hill, in the city's northwest, is Fajing Temple, formerly known as DaMing Temple.

A recent addition to the temple complex is the [[Jianzhen]] Memorial Hall, built according to Tang Dynasty methods and financed with contributions raised by Buddhist groups in Japan.\\nWhen Qing Emperor Qian Long visited Yangzhou in 1765, he was troubled by The temple's name DaMing (which literally means \\\"Great Ming') fearing that it might revive nostalgia for the Ming Dynasty, which was overthrown by his Manchu predecessors. He had it renamed Fajing Temple.\\nThe temple was seriously damaged during the Taiping Rebellion at the beginning of the 20th century. The present structure is a reconstruction dating from the 1930s.\\n\\n<gallery mode=\\\"packed\\\" heights=\\\"160px\\\">\\nImage:Daming temple.JPG|Da Ming Temple\\nImage:Jianzhen memorial hall.jpg|Memorial Hall of monk Jianzhen\\nImage:QilingP.jpg|Da Ming temple pagoda\\n</gallery>\\n\\n===Flat Hills (Ping Shan) Hall===\\nBuilt by the Song Dynasty writer Ouyang Xiu when he served as prefect of the city, this hall stands just west of Fajing Temple. Looking out from this hall, the mountains to the south of the Yangtze River appear as a line at the viewer's eye level, hence the name Flat Hills Hall.

These  songs, composed by [[Srimanta Sankardeva]] and [[Madhavdeva]] in the 15th-16th centuries, are used to begin prayer services in [[Satra (Ekasarana Dharma)|monasteries]], e.g. [[Satra (Ekasarana Dharma)|Satra]] and [[Namghar]] associated with the [[Ekasarana Dharma]]; and they also belong to the repertoire of [[Music of Assam]] outside the religious context. They are a lyrical strain that express the religious sentiments of the poets reacting to different situations,<ref>{{harv|Neog|1980|p=178}}</ref> and differ from other lyrics associated with the [[Ekasarana Dharma]].<ref>The other forms lyrics are the ''bhatima'' (laudatory odes), ''kirtan- and naam-ghoxa'' (lyrics for congregational singing), ''ankiya geet'' (lyrics set to beats and associated with the ''Ankiya Naat''), etc.</ref>  Similar songs composed by others are not generally considered borgeets.\\n\\nThe first Borgeet was composed by Srimanta Sankardeva during his first pilgrimage at [[Badrinath|Badrikashram]] in c1488, which is contemporaneous to the birth of [[Dhrupad]] in the court of [[Man Singh Tomar]] (1486-1518) of Gwalior.<ref>{{harv|Sanyal|2004|pp=45\\u201346}}</ref>\\n[[Brajavali dialect]] is a language native to the Braj region of [[Uttar Pradesh]], a state in [[India]]. Nowadays these areas are dominated by the identity of [[Bhojpuri]] (another important language covering mainly Uttar Pradesh and [[Bihar]]), mainly because of cinematic influence of the language over other local languages such as [[Maithili language|Maithili]], Awadhi, Brajavali, Bundelkhandi, Angika, Bajjika, etc. Brajaavali is also the language of the creations of Shankardev and Madhabdev in the form of scriptures which play as the base for today's religious bases of Assam, i.e. the [[Satra (Ekasarana Dharma)|Satra]]s where the prime deities are Rama and Krishna who again have their origins in Awadh, Gokul, Vrindaavan, Mathura areas of today's Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.\\n\\n==Lyrics==\\nThe ''borgeets'' are written in the ''pada'' form of verse. The first pada, marked as ''dhrung'',<ref>''Dhrung'' is likely an abbreviation of ''Dhruva'', the ''dhatu'' named in the Prabandha musical tradition {{harv|Mahanta|2008|p=52}}</ref>  works as a refrain and is repeated over the course of singing of the succeeding verses.<ref>{{harv|Neog|1980|p=278}}</ref>  In the last couplet, the name of the poet is generally mentioned.  The structure of borgeets is said to model the songs of 8-10th century [[Charyapada]].<ref>{{harv|Barua|1953|p=100}}</ref>\\n\\nThe first borgeet, ''mana meri rama-caranahi lagu'', was composed by the Sankardeva at Badrikashrama during his first pilgrimage.  The language he used for all his borgeets is [[Brajavali dialect|Brajavali]], an artificial Maithili-Assamese mix; though Madhavdeva used Brajavali very sparingly.<ref>\\\"Madhavdev did not use Brajabuli the way Sankardev did. If we dropped a few words, the language of most of Madhavdev's Borgeets reduce to old Assamese\\\" {{harv|Mahanta|2008|p=15}}.</ref>  Brajabuli, with its preponderance of vowels and alliterative expressions, as considered ideal for lyrical compositions, and Sankardeva used it for Borgeets and [[Ankia Naat]]s.<ref>{{harv|Barua|1953|pp=98\\u2013100}}</ref>  Sankardeva composed about two hundred and forty borgeets, but a fire destroyed them all and only about thirty four of them could be retrieved from memory.  Sankardeva, much saddened by this loss, gave up writing borgeets and asked Madhavdeva to write them instead.\\n\\nMadhavdeva composed more than two hundred borgeets, which focus mainly on the child-Krishna.<ref>{{harv|Sarma|1976|p=60}}</ref>\\n\\n==Music==\\n[[File:Alo Moi.ogg|thumb| Borgeet: ''Alu moi ki kohobu dukho''<br> Raga: ''Bhatiyali''<br>Composer: [[Madhavdeva]]<br>Artist: [[Ashwini Bhide-Deshpande]]]]\\nThe music of borgeets are based on [[raga]]s, which are clearly mentioned; and ''[[Raga#R\\u0101ga-R\\u0101gini system|raginis]]'', the female counterparts of ragas, are emphatically not used.<ref>{{harv|Neog|1980|p=286}}</ref>  The rhythm (''tala''), on the other hand, are not mentioned; and borgeets need not be set to rhythm.  Nevertheless, by convention tala is used when a borgeet is performed for an audience, or in a congregation, and in general specific ragas are associated with specific talas (e.g., ''Ashowari''-raga with ''yati-maan''; ''Kalyana''-raga with ''khar-maan'', etc.).<ref>{{harv|Neog|1980|p=278}}</ref>  The lightness that is associated with the [[khyal]] type of Indian classical music is absent, instead the music is closer to the [[Dhrupad]] style. The singing of a borgeet is preceded by ''raga diya'' or ''raga tana'', the local term for [[alap]], but unlike the syllables used in Khyal or Dhrupad, words like ''Rama'', ''Hari'', ''Govinda'', etc. are used.<ref>{{harv|Neog|1980|p=278}}</ref>  Furthermore, ''raga diya'' is fixed as opposed to ''alap'' which is improvised.\\n\\nThe technique of Borgeet follows the ''Prabandhan Gana'' tradition which is contemporary to [[Dhrupad]] and [[Kriti]] of [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] and [[Carnatic music]]. In Borgeets, there are [[Tala (music)|Tala]]<nowiki/>s from eight ''matra''s to thirty-two ''matra''s, all comprising three parts of proportionate length, viz., ''Ga-man, Ghat'' and ''Cok''. These ''Talas'' are different in structure, rhythmic pattern as well as playing style from the ''tala''s now played with [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]]<nowiki/>and [[Carnatic music]]. A few like ''Rupaka, Ektali, Yati, Bisam,'' etc. are mentioned not only in the ''Sangita Sastra''s like [[Sangita Ratnakara]] but also in [[Jayadeva]]\\u2019s [[Gita Govinda]]''.''<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/class-and-classical/article28283487.ece|title=Should Borgeet of Assam be recognised as a classical art form?|last=Rajan|first=Anjana|date=2019-07-04|work=The Hindu|access-date=2019-09-14|issn=0971-751X}}</ref>\\n[[File:Sankardev Satra Patbausi, Barpeta.jpg|thumb|A glimpse of a [[Satra (Ekasarana Dharma)|Sattra]], a major place of the origin of Borgeets.  ]]\\n<br />\\n\\n== Traditional Style of performing ==\\nIt is regarded that Borgeets have been forming an indispensable part of {{lang|as|Nama-Kirttana}} from the days of [[Sankardev|Sankardeva]]. The regular performance <nowiki/>of {{lang|as|Nama-Kirttana}} in [[Satra (Ekasarana Dharma)|Satra]] and [[Namghar]]s is done by a single person called {{lang|as|Nam-lagowa}}, where the {{lang|as|Nam-lagowa}} first sings only the outline of a [[raga]] suitable for that time of the day, and sings a Borgeet or an {{lang|as|Ankar git}} set in that raga without maintaining any beat, repeating the {{lang|as|Dhrung}}<nowiki/> or {{lang|as|Dhruva}} after every couplet of the {{lang|as|padas}} (subsequent verses). Such renderings of Borgeet are considered as a singing in {{lang|as|Bak-sanchar}} (sheer voice-manipulation) or {{lang|as|Melan}} (freedom from rhythmic restriction). The performance of {{lang|as|Nama-Kirttana}} in early morning accompanied by the [[Taal (instrument)|Khuti Taal]] is called a {{lang|as|Manjira-prasanga}}. The {{lang|as|Tal-kobowa prasanga}} performance which is accompanied by [[Taal (instrument)|Bortaal]] can be rendered in both morning and dusk. Both the ''Manjira-prasanga'' and ''Tal-kobowa prasanga'' are played with Borgeets. On occasions like [[Krishna Janmashtami]], [[Holi|Doul]], [[Bihu]], death anniversaries (''tithi)'' of religious preceptors including [[Sankardev]]a and [[Madhavdev]]a and during the whole month of [[Bhadra (Hindu calendar)|Bhadra]] the performance of Borgeet is preceded by an orchestral recital of [[Khol]]'', [[Taal (instrument)|Taal]], Negera'' (Percussion instrument) etc., which is variously referred to as ''Yora-prasanga, Khol-prasanga'' or ''Yogan-gowa.'' The orchestra comprises one or two pairs of ''Negera,''[[Taal (instrument)|Taal]], [[Khol]]s which are played in unison.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bharatiya Prajna: an Interdisciplinary Journal of Indian Studies|publisher=Aesthetics Media Services|doi = 10.21659/bp}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=B.|first=E.|last2=Prajnanananda|first2=Swami|date=September 1961|title=Historical Development of Indian Music|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=81|issue=4|pages=462|doi=10.2307/595734|issn=0003-0279|jstor=595734}}</ref>\\n\\n==Contemporary uses==\\nThe strict rules that are associated with the Borgeets, and still practiced in the Sattras, are eschewed in popular renderings.

These  songs, composed by [[Srimanta Sankardeva]] and [[Madhavdeva]] in the 15th-16th centuries, are used to begin prayer services in [[Satra (Ekasarana Dharma)|monasteries]], e.g. [[Satra (Ekasarana Dharma)|Satra]] and [[Namghar]] associated with the [[Ekasarana Dharma]]; and they also belong to the repertoire of [[Music of Assam]] outside the religious context. They are a lyrical strain that express the religious sentiments of the poets reacting to different situations,<ref>{{harv|Neog|1980|p=178}}</ref> and differ from other lyrics associated with the [[Ekasarana Dharma]].<ref>The other forms lyrics are the ''bhatima'' (laudatory odes), ''kirtan- and naam-ghoxa'' (lyrics for congregational singing), ''ankiya geet'' (lyrics set to beats and associated with the ''Ankiya Naat''), etc.</ref>  Similar songs composed by others are not generally considered borgeets.\\n\\nThe first Borgeet was composed by Srimanta Sankardeva during his first pilgrimage at [[Badrinath|Badrikashram]] in c1488, which is contemporaneous to the birth of [[Dhrupad]] in the court of [[Man Singh Tomar]] (1486-1518) of Gwalior.<ref>{{harv|Sanyal|2004|pp=45\\u201346}}</ref>\\n[[Brajavali dialect]] is a language native to the Braj region of [[Uttar Pradesh]], a state in [[India]]. Nowadays these areas are dominated by the identity of [[Bhojpuri]] (another important language covering mainly Uttar Pradesh and [[Bihar]]), mainly because of cinematic influence of the language over other local languages such as [[Maithili language|Maithili]], Awadhi, Brajavali, Bundelkhandi, Angika, Bajjika, etc. Brajaavali is also the language of the creations of Shankardev and Madhabdev in the form of scriptures which play as the base for today's religious bases of Assam, i.e. the [[Satra (Ekasarana Dharma)|Satra]]s where the prime deities are Rama and Krishna who again have their origins in Awadh, Gokul, Vrindaavan, Mathura areas of today's Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.\\n\\n==Lyrics==\\nThe ''borgeets'' are written in the ''pada'' form of verse. The first pada, marked as ''dhrung'',<ref>''Dhrung'' is likely an abbreviation of ''Dhruva'', the ''dhatu'' named in the Prabandha musical tradition {{harv|Mahanta|2008|p=52}}</ref>  works as a refrain and is repeated over the course of singing of the succeeding verses.<ref>{{harv|Neog|1980|p=278}}</ref>  In the last couplet, the name of the poet is generally mentioned.  The structure of borgeets is said to model the songs of 8-10th century [[Charyapada]].<ref>{{harv|Barua|1953|p=100}}</ref>\\n\\nThe first borgeet, ''mana meri rama-caranahi lagu'', was composed by the Sankardeva at Badrikashrama during his first pilgrimage.  The language he used for all his borgeets is [[Brajavali dialect|Brajavali]], an artificial Maithili-Assamese mix; though Madhavdeva used Brajavali very sparingly.<ref>\\\"Madhavdev did not use Brajabuli the way Sankardev did.

Sankardeva, much saddened by this loss, gave up writing borgeets and asked Madhavdeva to write them instead.\\n\\nMadhavdeva composed more than two hundred borgeets, which focus mainly on the child-Krishna.<ref>{{harv|Sarma|1976|p=60}}</ref>\\n\\n==Music==\\n[[File:Alo Moi.ogg|thumb| Borgeet: ''Alu moi ki kohobu dukho''<br> Raga: ''Bhatiyali''<br>Composer: [[Madhavdeva]]<br>Artist: [[Ashwini Bhide-Deshpande]]]]\\n\\nThe music of borgeets are based on [[raga]]s, which are clearly mentioned; and ''[[Raga#R\\u0101ga-R\\u0101gini system|raginis]]'', the female counterparts of ragas, are emphatically not used.<ref>{{harv|Neog|1980|p=286}}</ref>  The rhythm (''tala''), on the other hand, are not mentioned; and borgeets need not be set to rhythm.  Nevertheless, by convention tala is used when a borgeet is performed for an audience, or in a congregation, and in general specific ragas are associated with specific talas (e.g., ''Ashowari''-raga with ''yati-maan''; ''Kalyana''-raga with ''khar-maan'', etc.).<ref>{{harv|Neog|1980|p=278}}</ref>  The lightness that is associated with the [[khyal]] type of Indian classical music is absent, instead the music is closer to the [[Dhrupad]] style. The singing of a borgeet is preceded by ''raga diya'' or ''raga tana'', the local term for [[alap]], but unlike the syllables used in Khyal or Dhrupad, words like ''Rama'', ''Hari'', ''Govinda'', etc. are used.<ref>{{harv|Neog|1980|p=278}}</ref>  Furthermore, ''raga diya'' is fixed as opposed to ''alap'' which is improvised.\\n\\nThe technique of Borgeet follows the ''Prabandhan Gana'' tradition which is contemporary to [[Dhrupad]] and [[Kriti]] of [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] and [[Carnatic music]]. In Borgeets, there are [[Tala (music)|Tala]]<nowiki/>s from eight ''matra''s to thirty-two ''matra''s, all comprising three parts of proportionate length, viz., ''Ga-man, Ghat'' and ''Cok''. These ''Talas'' are different in structure, rhythmic pattern as well as playing style from the ''tala''s now played with [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]]<nowiki/>and [[Carnatic music]]. A few like ''Rupaka, Ektali, Yati, Bisam,'' etc. are mentioned not only in the ''Sangita Sastra''s like [[Sangita Ratnakara]] but also in [[Jayadeva]]\\u2019s [[Gita Govinda]]''.''<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/class-and-classical/article28283487.ece|title=Should Borgeet of Assam be recognised as a classical art form?|last=Rajan|first=Anjana|date=2019-07-04|work=The Hindu|access-date=2019-09-14|issn=0971-751X}}</ref>\\n[[File:Sankardev Satra Patbausi, Barpeta.jpg|thumb|A glimpse of a [[Satra (Ekasarana Dharma)|Sattra]], a major place of the origin of Borgeets.  ]]\\n<br />\\n\\n== Traditional Style of performing ==\\nIt is regarded that Borgeets have been forming an indispensable part of {{lang|as|Nama-Kirttana}} from the days of [[Sankardev|Sankardeva]]. The regular performance <nowiki/>of {{lang|as|Nama-Kirttana}} in [[Satra (Ekasarana Dharma)|Satra]] and [[Namghar]]s is done by a single person called {{lang|as|Nam-lagowa}}, where the {{lang|as|Nam-lagowa}} first sings only the outline of a [[raga]] suitable for that time of the day, and sings a Borgeet or an {{lang|as|Ankar git}} set in that raga without maintaining any beat, repeating the {{lang|as|Dhrung}}<nowiki/> or {{lang|as|Dhruva}} after every couplet of the {{lang|as|padas}} (subsequent verses). Such renderings of Borgeet are considered as a singing in {{lang|as|Bak-sanchar}} (sheer voice-manipulation) or {{lang|as|Melan}} (freedom from rhythmic restriction). The performance of {{lang|as|Nama-Kirttana}} in early morning accompanied by the [[Taal (instrument)|Khuti Taal]] is called a {{lang|as|Manjira-prasanga}}. The {{lang|as|Tal-kobowa prasanga}} performance which is accompanied by [[Taal (instrument)|Bortaal]] can be rendered in both morning and dusk. Both the ''Manjira-prasanga'' and ''Tal-kobowa prasanga'' are played with Borgeets. On occasions like [[Krishna Janmashtami]], [[Holi|Doul]], [[Bihu]], death anniversaries (''tithi)'' of religious preceptors including [[Sankardev]]a and [[Madhavdev]]a and during the whole month of [[Bhadra (Hindu calendar)|Bhadra]] the performance of Borgeet is preceded by an orchestral recital of [[Khol]]'', [[Taal (instrument)|Taal]], Negera'' (Percussion instrument) etc., which is variously referred to as ''Yora-prasanga, Khol-prasanga'' or ''Yogan-gowa.'' The orchestra comprises one or two pairs of ''Negera,''[[Taal (instrument)|Taal]], [[Khol]]s which are played in unison.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bharatiya Prajna: an Interdisciplinary Journal of Indian Studies|publisher=Aesthetics Media Services|doi = 10.21659/bp}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=B.|first=E.|last2=Prajnanananda|first2=Swami|date=September 1961|title=Historical Development of Indian Music|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=81|issue=4|pages=462|doi=10.2307/595734|issn=0003-0279|jstor=595734}}</ref>\\n\\n==Contemporary uses==\\nThe strict rules that are associated with the Borgeets, and still practiced in the Sattras, are eschewed in popular renderings.
